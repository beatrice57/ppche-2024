Penn Parsed Corpora of Historical English (PPCHE) - 2024 release
================================================================

The most recent release of the PPCHE is unfortunately no longer
available on github, as my posting on github infringes on prior
distribution rights by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC).

The corpora will become available from the LDC catalog in due course.
Please see the PPCHE page 
<https://www.ling.upenn.edu/hist-corpora/index-2024.html> for details as
they become available.

I respectfully request those of you who have downloaded the corpora from
github to refrain from distributing them further, and I apologize for
any inconvenience caused by my misunderstanding of the distribution
rights at issue.
