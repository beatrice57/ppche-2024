John Udall (c1560-1592) was a Cambridge-educated Puritan who helped John
Penry publish several anticlerical pamphlets and wrote two anti-Anglican
tracts of his own.  He was arrested, charged with authorship, and
sentenced to death; he died in prison shortly after receiving a pardon
(http://www.encyclopedia.com/html/U/Udall-U1d.asp). </td>
