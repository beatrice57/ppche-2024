SOME PASSAGES OF THE LIFE AND DEATH OF JOHN EARL OF ROCHESTER
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,1.4

<$$heading>

<font> John Wilmot <$$font> Earl of <font> Rochester <$$font> was born
in <font> April , Anno Dom. <$$font> 1648 . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,1.6

his father was <font> Henry <$$font> Earl of <font> Rochester <$$font> ,
but best known by the Title of the Lord <P_2> <font> Wilmot <$$font> ,
who bore so great a part in all the late Wars , that mention is often
made of him in the History : And had the chief share in the Honour of
the preservation of His Majesty that now Reigns , after <font> Worcester
<$$font> -Fight , and the Conveying Him from Place to Place , till he
happily escaped into <font> France <$$font> : BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,2.7

But dying before the King's Return , he left his Son little other
Inheritance , but the Honour and Title derived to him , with the
pretensions such eminent Services gave him to the King's Favour :
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,2.8

These were carefully managed by the great prudence and discretion of his
Mother , a Daughter of that Noble and ancient Family of the <font> St.
Johns <$$font> of <font> Wiltshire <$$font> , so that his Education was
<P_3> carried on all things sutably to his Quality .
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,3.9

When he was at School he was an extraordinary Proficient at his Book :
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,3.10

and those shining parts , which have since appeared with so much lustre
; began then to shew themselves : BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,3.11

He acquired the <font> Latin <$$font> to such perfection , that to his
dying-day he retained a great rellish of the fineness and Beauty of that
Tongue : and was exactly versed in the incomparable Authors that writ
about <font> Augustus's <$$font> time , whom he read often with that
peculiar delight which the greatest Wits have ever found in those
Studies . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,3.12

When he went to the <font> University <$$font> the general Joy which
over-ran the whole Nation upon his Majesties <font> Restauration
<$$font> , <P_4> but was not regulated with that Sobriety and Temperance
, that became a serious gratitude to God for so great a Blessing ,
produced some of its ill effects on him : BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,4.13

He began to love these disorders too much ; BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,4.14

His Tutor was that Eminent and Pious Divine Dr. <font> Blandford
<$$font> , afterwards promoted to the Sees of <font> Oxford <$$font> and
<font> Worcester <$$font> : BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,4.15

And under his Inspection , he was committed to the more immediate care
of Mr. <font> Phineas Berry <$$font> , a Fellow of <font> Wadham
<$$font> -Colledge , a very learned and good_natured man ; whom he
afterwards ever used with much respect , and rewarded him as became a
great man . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,4.16

But the humour of that time wrought so much on him , that he broke off
the Course of his Studies ; to which no means <P_5> could ever
effectually recall him ; till when he was in <font> Italy <$$font> his
Governor , Dr. <font> Balfour <$$font> , a learned and worthy man , now
a Celebrated Physitian in <font> Scotland <$$font> , his Native Country
; drew him to read such Books , as were most likely to bring him back to
love Learning and Study : BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,5.17

and he often acknowledged to me , in particular three days before his
Death , how much he was obliged to Love and Honour this his Governour ,
to whom he thought he owed more than {he_owed_to} to all the World ,
next after his Parents , for his great Fidelity and Care of him , while
he was under his trust . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,5.18

But no part of it affected him more sensibly , than {it_affected_him}
that he engaged him by many tricks <paren> so he expressed it <$$paren>
to delight in <P_6> Books and reading ; So that ever after he took
occasion in the Intervals of those woful Extravagancies that consumed
most of his time to read much : BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,6.19

and though the time was generally but indifferently employed , for the
choice of the Subjects of his Studies was not always good , yet the
habitual Love of Knowledge together with these fits of study , had much
awakened his Understanding , BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,6.20

and prepared him for better things , when his mind should be so far
changed as to rellish them . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,6.21

He came from his Travels in the 18th Year of his {HELSINKI:his_his} Age
, BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,6.22

and appeared at Court with as great Advantages as most ever had .
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,6.23

He was a Graceful and well shaped Person , tall and well <P_7> made , if
not a little too slender : BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,7.24

He was exactly well bred , BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,7.25

and what by a modest behaviour natural to him , what by a Civility
become almost as natural , his Conversation was easie and obliging .
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,7.26

He had a strange Vivacity of thought , and vigour of expression :
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,7.27

His Wit had a subtility and sublimity both , that were scarce imitable .
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,7.28

His Style was clear and strong : BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,7.29

When he used Figures they were very lively , and yet far enough out of
the Common Road : BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,7.30

he had made himself Master of the Ancient and Modern Wit , and of the
Modern <font> French <$$font> and <font> Italian <$$font> as well as the
<font> English <$$font> . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,7.31

He loved to talk and write of Speculative Matters ,
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,7.32

and did it with so fine a thread , that even those who hated the
Subjects <P_8> that his Fancy ran upon , yet could not but be charmed
with his way of treating them . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,8.33

<font> Boileau <$$font> among the <font> French <$$font> , and <font>
Cowley <$$font> among the <font> English <$$font> Wits , were those he
admired most . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,8.34

Sometimes other mens thoughts mixed with his Composures ,
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,8.35

but that flowed rather from the Impressions they made on him when he
read them , by which they came to return upon him as his own thoughts ;
than {it_flowed_from_the_fact} that he servilely copied from any .
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,8.36

For few men ever had a bolder flight of fancy , more steddily governed
by Judgment than he had . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,8.37

No wonder a young man so made , and so improved was very acceptable in a
Court . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,8.38

Soon after his coming thither he laid hold on the first Occasion that
offered to shew his readiness <P_9> to hazard his life in the Defence
and Service of his Country . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,9.39

In <font> Winter <$$font> 1665 . he went with the Earl of <font>
Sandwich <$$font> to Sea , when he was sent to lie for the <font> Dutch
East-India Fleet <$$font> ; and was in the <font> Revenge <$$font> ,
Commanded by Sir <font> Thomas Tiddiman <$$font> , when the Attack was
made on the Port of <font> Bergen <$$font> in <font> Norway <$$font> ,
the <font> Dutch <$$font> ships having got into that <font> Port
<$$font> . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,9.40

It was as desperate an Attempt as ever was made :
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,9.41

during the whole Action , the Earl of <font> Rochester <$$font> shewed
as brave and as resolute a Courage as was possible :
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,9.42

a Person of Honour told me he heard the Lord <font> Clifford <$$font> ,
who was in the same Ship , often magnifie his Courage at that time very
highly . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,9.43

Nor did the Rigours of the Season , the <P_10> hardness of the Voyage ,
and the extream danger he had been in , deter him from running the like
on the very next Occasion ; BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,10.44

For the <font> Summer <$$font> following he went to Sea again , without
communicating his design to his nearest Relations .
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,10.45

He went aboard the Ship Commanded by Sir <font> Edward Spragge <$$font>
the day before the great Sea-fight of that Year :
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,10.46

Almost all the Volunteers that were in the same Ship were killed .
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,10.47

Mr. <font> Middleton <$$font> <paren> brother to Sir <font> Hugh
Middleton <$$font> <$$paren> was shot in his Arms .
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,10.48

During the Action , Sir <font> Edward Spragge <$$font> , not being
satisfied with the behaviour of one of the Captains , could not easily
find a Person that would chearfully venture through so much danger , to
carry his Commands to that <P_11> Captain . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,11.49

This Lord offered himself to the Service ; BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,11.50

and went in a little Boat , through all the shot ,
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,11.51

and delivered his Message , BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,11.52

and returned back to Sir <font> Edward <$$font> : which was much
commended by all that saw it . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,11.53

He thought it necessary to begin his life with these Demonstrations of
his Courage in an Element and way of fighting , which is acknowledged to
be the greatest trial of clear and undaunted Valour .
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,11.54

He had so entirely laid down the Intemperance that was growing on him
before his Travels , that at his Return he hated nothing more .
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,11.55

But falling into Company that loved these Excesses , he was , though not
without difficulty , and by many steps , brought back to it <P_12> again
. BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,12.56

And the natural heat of his fancy , being inflamed by Wine , made him so
extravagantly pleasant , that many to be more diverted by that humor ,
studied to engage him deeper and deeper in Intemperance : which at
length did so entirely subdue him ; that , as he told me , for five
years together he was continually Drunk : BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,12.57

not all the while under the visible effect of it ,
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,12.58

but his blood was so inflamed , that he was not in all that time cool
enough to be perfectly Master of himself . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,12.59

This led him to say and do many wild and unaccountable things :
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,12.60

By this , he said , he had broke the firm constitution of his Health ,
that seemed so strong , that nothing was too hard for it ;
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,12.61

and he had suffered <P_13> so much in his Reputation , that he almost
dispaired to recover it . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,13.62

There were two Principles in his natural temper , that being heighten'd
by that heat carried him to great excesses : a violent love of Pleasure
, and a disposition to extravagant Mirth . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,13.63

The one involved him in great sensuality : BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,13.64

the other led him to many odd Adventures and Frollicks , in which he was
oft in hazard of his life . The one being the same irregular appetite
in his Mind , that the other was in his Body , which made him think
nothing diverting that was not extravagant . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,13.65

And though in cold blood he was a generous and good_natured man , yet he
would go far in his heats , after any thing that might turn to a Jest or
matter <P_14> of Diversion : BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,14.66

He said to me , He never improved his Interest at Court , to do a
premeditate Mischief to other persons . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,14.67

Yet he laid out his Wit very freely in <font> Libels <$$font> and <font>
Satyrs <$$font> , in which he had a peculiar Talent of mixing his Wit
with his Malice , and fitting both with such apt words , that Men were
tempted to be pleased with them : BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,14.68

from thence his Composures came to be easily known ,
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,14.69

for few had such a way of tempering these together as he had ; So that
when any thing extraordinary that way came out , as a Child is fathered
sometimes by its Resemblance , so was it laid at his Door as its Parent
and Author . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,14.70

These Exercises in the course of his life were not always <P_15> equally
pleasant to him ; BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,15.71

he had often sad Intervals and severe Reflections on them :
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,15.72

and though then he had not these awakened in him from any deep Principle
of Religion , yet the horrour that Nature raised in him , especially in
some Sicknesses , made him too easie to receive some ill Principles ,
which others endeavoured to possess him with ; so that he was too soon
brought to set himself to secure , and fortifie his Mind against that ,
by dispossessing it all he could of the belief or apprehensions of
Religion . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,15.73

The Licentiousness of his temper , with the briskness of his Wit ,
disposed him to love the Conversation of those who divided their time
between lewd Actions and irregular <P_16> Mirth .
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,16.74

And so he came to bend his Wit , and direct his Studies and Endeavours
to support and strengthen these ill Principles in himself and others .
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,16.75

An accident fell out after this , which confirmed him more in these
Courses : BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,16.76

when he went to Sea in the Year 1665 , there happened to be in the same
Ship with him Mr. <font> Mountague <$$font> and another Gentleman of
Quality , BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,16.77

these two , the former especially , seemed perswaded that they should
never return into <font> England <$$font> . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,16.78

Mr. <font> Mountague <$$font> said , He was sure of it :
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,16.79

the other was not so positive . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,16.80

The Earl of <font> Rochester <$$font> , and the last of these , entred
into a formal Engagement , not without Ceremonies of Religion , that if
<P_17> either of them died , he should appear , and give the other
notice of the future State , if there was any .
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,17.81

But Mr. <font> Mountague <$$font> would not enter into the Bond .
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,17.82

When the day came that they thought to have taken the <font> Dutch-@
<$$font> @Fleet in the Port of <font> Bergen <$$font> , Mr. <font>
Mountague <$$font> though he had such a strong Presage in his Mind of
his approaching death , yet he generously staid all the while in the
place of greatest danger : BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,17.83

The other Gentleman signalized his Courage in a most undaunted manner ,
till near the end of the Action ; when he fell on a sudden into such a
trembling that he could scarce stand ; BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,17.84

and Mr. <font> Mountague <$$font> going to him to hold him up , as they
were in each others Arms , a Cannon <P_18> Ball killed him outright ,
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,18.85

and carried away Mr. <font> Mountague's <$$font> Belly , so that he
died within an hour after . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,18.86

The Earl of <font> Rochester <$$font> told me that these Presages they
had in their minds made some impression on him , that there were
separated Beings : and that the Soul , either by a natural sagacity , or
some secret Notice communicated to it , had a sort of Divination :
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,18.87

But that Gentlemans never appearing was a great snare to him , during
the rest of his life . Though when he told me this , he could not but
acknowledge , it was as unreasonable thing for him , to think , that
Beings in another State were not under such Laws and Limits , that they
could not command their own motions , <P_19> but as the Supream Power
should order them : and that one who had so corrupted the Natural
Principles of Truth , as he had , had no reason to expect that such an
extraordinary thing should be done for his Conviction .
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,19.88

He told me of another odd Presage that one had of his approaching Death
in the Lady <font> Warre <$$font> , his Mother_in_Law@ @s house :
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,19.89

The Chaplain had dream't that such a day he should die ,
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,19.90

but being by all the Family put out of the belief of it , he had almost
forgot it ; till the Evening before at Supper , there being Thirteen at
Table ; according to a fond conceit that one of these must soon die ,
One of the young Ladies pointed to him , that he was to <P_20> die .
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,20.91

He remembering his Dream fell into some disorder
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,20.92

and the Lady <font> Warre <$$font> reproving him for his Superstition ,
he said , He was confident he was to die before Morning ,
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,20.93

but he being in perfect health , it was not much minded .
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,20.94

It was <font> Saturday <$$font> -Night , BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,20.95

and he was to Preach next day . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,20.96

He went to his Chamber BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,20.97

and sate up late , as appeared by the burning of his Candle ,
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,20.98

and he had been preparing his Notes for his Sermon ,
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,20.99

but was found dead in his Bed the next Morning :
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,20.100

These things he said made him inclined to believe , the Soul was a
substance distinct from matter : BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,20.101

and this often returned into his thoughts . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,20.102

But that which perfected his perswasion about it , was , that in the
Sickness <P_21> which brought him so near death before I first knew him
, when his Spirits were so low and spent , that he could not move nor
stir , and he did not think to live an hour ; He said , His Reason and
Judgment were so clear and strong , that from thence he was fully
perswaded that Death was not the spending or dissolution of the Soul ;
but only the separation of it from matter . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,21.103

He had in that Sickness great Remorses for his past Life ,
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,21.104

but he afterwards told me , They were rather general and dark Horrours ,
than any Convictions of sinning against God .
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,21.105

He was sorry he had lived so as to wast his strength so soon , or that
he had brought such an ill name upon himself ,
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,21.106

and had an Agony in <P_22> his Mind about it , which he knew not well
how to express : BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,22.107

But at such times , though he complied with his Friends in suffering
Divines to be sent for , he said , He had no great mind to it : and that
it was but a piece of his breeding , to desire them to pray by him , in
which he joyned little himself . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,22.108

As to the Supream Being , he had always some Impression of one :
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,22.109

and professed often to me , That he had never known an entire <font>
Atheist <$$font> , who fully believed there was no God .
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,22.110

Yet when he explained his Notion of this Being , it amounted to no more
than a vast power , that had none of the Attributes of Goodness or
Justice , we ascribe to the Deity : BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,22.111

These were his thoughts about Religion , <P_23> as himself told me .
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,23.112

For Morality , he freely own'd to me , that though he talked of it , as
a fine thing , yet this was only because he thought it a decent way of
speaking , and that as they went always in Cloaths , though in their
Frollicks they would have chosen sometimes to have gone naked , if they
had not feared the people : So though some of them found it necessary
for humane life to talk of Morality , yet he confessed they cared not
for it , further than the reputation of it was necessary for their
credit , and affairs : of which he gave me many Instances , as their
professing and swearing Friendship , where they hated mortally ; their
Oaths and Imprecations in their Addresses to Women , <P_24> which they
intended never to make good ; the pleasure they took in defaming
innocent Persons , and spreading false Reports of some , perhaps in
Revenge , because they could not enage {COM:sic} them to comply with
their ill Designs : The delight they had in making people quarrel ;
their unjust usage of their Creditors , and putting them off by any
deceitful Promise they could invent , that might deliver them from
present Importunity . So that in detestation of these Courses he would
often break forth into such hard Expressions concerning himself as would
be indecent for another to repeat . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,24.113

Such had been his Principles and Practices in a Course of many years
which had almost <P_25> quite extinguish't the natural Propensities in
him to Justice and Vertue : BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,25.114

He would often go into the Country , and be for some months wholly
imployed in Study , or the Sallies of his Wit : Which he came to direct
chiefly to <font> Satyre <$$font> . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,25.115

And this he often defended to me ; by saying there were some people that
could not be kept in Order , or admonished but in this way .
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,25.116

I replied , That it might be granted that a grave way of <font> Satyre
<$$font> was sometimes no improfitable way of Reproof .
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,25.117

and Yet they who used it only out of spite , and mixed Lyes with Truth ,
sparing nothing that might adorn their <font> Poems <$$font> , or
gratifie their Revenge , could not excuse that way of Reproach , by
which <P_26> the Innocent often suffer : since the most malicious things
, if wittily expressed , might stick to and blemish the best men in the
World , and the malice of a Libel could hardly consist with the Charity
of an Admonition . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,26.118

To this he answered , A man could not write with life , unless he were
heated by Revenge : BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,26.119

For to make a <font> Satyre <$$font> without Resentments , upon the cold
Notions of <font> Phylosophy <$$font> , was as if a man would in cold
blood , cut mens throats who had never offended him :
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,26.120

And he said , The Lyes in these Libels came ofen in as Ornaments that
could not be spared without spoiling the beauty of the <font> Poem
<$$font> . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,26.121

For his other Studies , they were divided between the Comical <P_27> and
witty Writings of the Ancients and Moderns , the <font> Roman <$$font>
Authors , and Books of Physick : which the ill state of health he was
fallen into , made more necessary to himself : and which qualifi'd him
for an odd adventure , which I shall but just mention .
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,27.122

Being under an unlucky Accident , which obliged him to keep out of the
way ; He disguised himself , so that his nearest Friends could not have
known him , BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,27.123

and set up in <font> Tower-street <$$font> for an <font> Italian
Mountebank <$$font> , where he practised Physick for some Weeks not
without success . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,27.124

In his later years , he read Books of History more .
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,27.125

He took pleasure to disguise himself as a <font> Porter <$$font> , or as
a <font> Beggar <$$font> ; sometimes to follow <P_28> some mean Amours ,
which , for the variety of them , he affected ;
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,28.126

At other times , meerly for diversion , he would go about in odd shapes
, in which he acted his part so naturally , that even those who were in
the secret , and saw him in these shapes , could perceive nothing by
which he might be discovered . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,28.127

<P_136>

He told me when I saw him , That he hoped I would come to him upon that
general Insinuation of the desire he had of my Company ; and he was loth
to write more plainly : not knowing whether I could easily spare so much
time . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,136.129

I told him , That on the other hand , I looked on it as a presumption to
come so far , when he was in such excellent hands ;
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,136.130

and though perhaps the freedom formerly between us , might have excused
it with those to whom it was known ; yet it might have the appearance of
so much Vanity , to such as were strangers to it ; So that till I
received his Letter , I did not think it convenient to come to him :
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,136.131

And then not hearing that there was any danger of a sudden change , I
<P_137> delayed going to him till the Twentieth of <font> July <$$font>
. BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,137.132

At my coming to his House an accident fell out not worth mentioning ,
but that some have made a story of it . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,137.133

His Servant , being a <font> French-man <$$font> , carried up my Name
wrong , so that he mistook it for another , who had sent to him , that
he would undertake his Cure , BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,137.134

and he being resolved not to meddle with him , did not care to see him :
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,137.135

This mistake lasted some hours , with which I was better contented ,
because he was not then in such a condition that my being about him
could have been of any use to him : BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,137.136

for that Night was like to have been his last .
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,137.137

He had a <font> Convulsion-Fit <$$font> , BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,137.138

and raved ; BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,137.139

but , <font> Opiates <$$font> being given him , after some hours <P_138>
rest , his raving left him so entirely , that it never again returned to
him . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,138.140

I can@ @not easily express the Transport he was in , when he awoke and
saw me by him : BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,138.141

He brake out in the tenderest Expressions concerning my kindness in
coming so far to see <font> such a One <$$font> , using terms of great
abhorrence concerning himself , which I forbear to relate .
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,138.142

He told me , as his strength served him at several snatches , for he was
then so low , that he could not hold up discourse long at once , what
sense he had of his past life ; what sad apprehension for having so
offended his Maker , and dishonoured his Redeemer : What Horrours he had
gone through , and how much his Mind was turned to <P_139> call on God ,
and on his Crucified Saviour : So that he hoped he should obtain Mercy ,
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,139.143

for he believed he had sincerely repented ; and had now a calm in his
Mind after that storm that he had been in for some Weeks .
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,139.144

He had strong Apprehensions and Perswasions of his admittance to Heaven
: of which he spake once not without some extraordinary Emotion .
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,139.145

It was indeed the only time that he spake with any great warmth to me :
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,139.146

For his Spirits were then low , and so far spent , that though those
about him told me , He had expressed formerly great fervor in his
Devotions ; Yet Nature was so much sunk , that these were in a great
measure fallen off . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,139.147

But he made me pray <P_140> often with him ; BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,140.148

and spoke of his Conversion to God as a thing now grown up in him to a
setled and calm serenity . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,140.149

He was very anxious to know {SIC:known} my Opinion of a Death-Bed
Repentance . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,140.150

I told him , That before I gave any Resolution in that , it would be
convenient that I should be acquainted more particularly with the
Circumstances and Progress of his Repentance .
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,140.151

Upon this he satisfied me in many particulars .
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,140.152

He said , He was now perswaded both of the truth of <font> Christianity
<$$font> , and of the power of inward Grace , of which he gave me this
strange account . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,140.153

He said , Mr. <font> Parsons <$$font> in order to his Conviction , read
to him the 53. <font> Chapter <$$font> of the Prophesie of <P_141>
<font> Isaiah <$$font> , BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,141.154

and compared <font> that <$$font> with the History of our Saviour's
Passion , that he might there see a Prophesie concerning it , written
many Ages before it was done ; which the <font> Jews <$$font> that
blasphemed Jesus Christ still kept in their hands , as a Book divinely
inspired . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,141.155

He said to me , <font> That as he heard it read , he felt an inward
force upon him , which did so enlighten his Mind , and convince him ,
that he could resist it no longer : BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,141.156

For the words had an authority which did shoot like Raies or Beams in
his Mind ; So that he was not only convinced by the Reasonings he had
about it , which satisfied his Understanding , but by a power which did
so effectually constrain him , that he did ever after as firmly believe
in his Saviour , as if he had seen <P_142> him in the Clouds <$$font> .
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,142.157

He had made it to be read so often to him , that he had got it by heart
: BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,142.158

and went through a great part of it in Discourse with me , with a sort
of heavenly Pleasure , giving me his Reflections on it .
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,142.159

Some few I remember , <font> Who hath believed our Report <$$font> ?
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,142.160

<font> Here <$$font> , he said , <font> was foretold the Opposition the
Gospel was to meet with from such Wretches as he was .
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,142.161

He hath no Form nor Comliness , BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,142.162

and when we shall see Him , there is no beauty that we should desire him
<$$font> . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,142.163

On this he said , <font> The meanness of his appearance and Person has
made vain and foolish people disparage Him , because he came not in such
a Fools-Coat as they delight in <$$font> . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,142.164

What he said on the other parts I do not well remember :
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,142.165

and indeed I was so affected with <P_143> what he said then to me , that
the general transport I was under during the whole Discourse , made me
less capable to remember these Particulars , as I wish I had done .
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,143.166

He told me , That he had thereupon received the Sacrament with great
satisfaction and that was encreased by the pleasure he had in his Ladies
receiving it with him : who had been for some years misled into the
Communion of the Church of <font> Rome <$$font> ,
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,143.167

and he himself had been not a little Instrumental in procuring it , as
he freely acknowledged . So that it was one of the joyfullest things
that befel him in his Sickness , that he had seen that Mischief removed
, in which he had so great a Hand : BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,143.168

and <P_144> during his whole Sickness , he expressed so much tenderness
and true kindness to his Lady , that as it easily defaced the
remembrance of every thing wherein he had been in fault formerly , so it
drew from her the most passionate care and concern for him that was
possible : which indeed deserves a higher Character than is decent to
give of a Person yet alive . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,144.169

But I shall confine my Discourse to the Dead .
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,144.170

He told me , He had overcome all his Resentments to all the World ; So
that he bore ill will to no Person , nor hated any upon personal
accounts . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,144.171

He had given a true state of his Debts , BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,144.172

and had ordered to pay them all , as far as his Estate that was not
setled , could go : BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,144.173

<P_145>

and was confident that if all that was owing to him were paid to his
Executors , his Creditors would be all satisfied .
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,145.175

He said , He found his Mind now possessed with another sense of things
than ever he had formerly : BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,145.176

He did not repine under all his pain , BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,145.177

and in one of the sharpest Fits he was under while I was with him ; He
said , <font> He did willingly submit <$$font> ;
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,145.178

and looking up to Heaven , said , <font> God's holy Will be done ,
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,145.179

I bless Him for all He does to me <$$font> .
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,145.180

He professed he was contented either to die or live , as should please
God : BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,145.181

And though it was a foolish thing for a man to pretend to choose ,
Whether he would die or live , yet he wished rather to die .
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,145.182

He knew he could never be so well , that life should be <P_146>
comfortable to him . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,146.183

He was confident he should be happy if he died
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,146.184

but he feared if he lived he might Relapse : BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,146.185

And then said he to me , <font> In what a condition shall I be , if I
Relapse after all this ? BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,146.186

But <$$font> , he said , <font> he trusted in the Grace and Goodness of
God , and was resolved to avoid all those Temptations , that Course of
Life , and Company , that was likely to insnare him :
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,146.187

and he desired to live on no other account , but that he might by the
change of his Manners some way take off the high Scandal his former
Behaviour had given <$$font> . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,146.188

All these things at several times I had from him , besides some Messages
which very well became a dying Penitent to some of his former Friends ,
and a Charge to publish any thing <P_147> concerning him , that might be
a mean to reclaim others . <font> Praying God , that as his life had
done much hurt , so his death might do some good . <$$font>
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,147.189

Having understood all these things from him , and being pressed to give
him my Opinion plainly about his Eternal State ; I told him , That
though the Promises of the Gospel did all depend upon a real change of
Heart and Life , as the indispensable condition upon which they were
made ; and that it was scarce possible to know certainly whether our
Hearts are changed , unless it appeared in our lives ; and the
Repentance of most dying men , being like the howlings of condemned
Prisoners for Pardon , which flowed from no sense of their <P_148>
Crimes , but from the horrour of approaching Death ; there was little
reason to encourage any to hope much from such Sorrowing : Yet certainly
if the Mind of a Sinner , even on a Death-Bed , be truly renewed and
turned to God , so great is His Mercy , that He will receive him , even
in that extremity . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,148.190

He said , <font> He was sure his Mind was entirely turned and though
Horrour had given him his first awaking , yet that was now grown up into
a setled Faith and Conversion <$$font> . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,148.191

There is but one prejudice lies against all this , to defeat the good
Ends of Divine Providence by it upon others , as well as on himself :
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,148.192

and that is that it was a part of his Disease , and that the lowness of
<P_149> his Spirits made such an alteration in him , that he was not
what he had formerly been : BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,149.193

and this some have carried so far as to say , That he died mad :
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,149.194

These Reports are raised by those who are unwilling that the last
Thoughts or Words of a Person , every way so extraordinary , should have
any effect either on themselves or others : BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,149.195

And it is to be fear'd , that some may have so far feared their
Consciences , and exceeded the common Measures of Sin and Infidelity ,
that neither this Testimony , nor one coming from the Dead , would
signifie much towards their Conviction . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,149.196

That this Lord was either mad or stupid , is a thing so notoriously
untrue , that it is the greatest Impudence <P_150> for any that were
about him , to Report it ; and a very unreasonable Credulity in others
to believe it . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,150.197

All the while I was with him , after he had slept out the disorders of
the Fit he was in the first Night , he was not only without Ravings ;
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,150.198

but had a clearness in his Thoughts , in his Memory , in his reflections
on Things and Persons , far beyond what I ever saw in a Person so low in
his strength . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,150.199

He was not able to hold out long in Discourse ,
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,150.200

for his Spirits failed : BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,150.201

but once for half an hour , and often for a quarter of an hour , after
he awakened , he had a Vivacity in his Discourse that was extraordinary
, and in all things like himself . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,150.202

He called often for his Children , his Son the now Earl of <font>
Rochester <$$font> , <P_151> and his three Daughters ,
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,151.203

and spake to them with a sense and feeling that can@ @not be expressed
in Writing . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,151.204

He called me once to look on them all , BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,151.205

and said , <font> See how Good God has been to me , in giving me so many
Blessings , BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,151.206

and I have carried my self to Him like an ungracious and unthankful Dog
<$$font> . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,151.207

He once talked a great deal to me of Publick Affairs , and of many
Persons and things , with the same clearness of thought and expression ,
that he had ever done before . So that by no sign , but his Weakness of
Body , and giving over Discourse so soon , could I perceive a difference
between what his Parts formerly were , and what they were then .
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,151.208

And that wherein the presence of his Mind appeared <P_152> most , was in
the total change of an ill habit grown so much upon him , that he could
hardly govern himself , when he was any ways heated , three Minutes
without falling into it ; BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,152.209

I mean <font> Swearing <$$font> . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,152.210

He had acknowledged to me the former Winter , that he abhorred it as a
base and indecent thing , and had set himself much to break it off :
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,152.211

but he confessed that he was so over-power'd by that ill Custom , that
he could not speak with any warmth , without repeated Oaths , which ,
upon any sort of provocation , came almost naturally from him :
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,152.212

But in his last Remorses this did so sensibly affect him , that by a
resolute and constant watchfulness , the habit of it was perfectly
master'd ; So that , <P_153> upon the returns of pain which were very
severe and frequent upon him , the last day I was with him ; or upon
such Displeasures as people sick or in pain are apt to take of a sudden
at those about them ; On all these Occasions he never swore an Oath all
the while I was there . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,153.213

Once he was offended with the delay of one that he thought made not hast
enough , with somewhat he called for , BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,153.214

and said in a little heat , <font> That damned Fellow <$$font> :
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,153.215

Soon after I told him , I was glad to find his Style so reformed , and
that he had so entirely overcome that ill habit of Swearing ;
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,153.216

Only that word of calling any <font> damned <$$font> , which had
returned upon him , was not decent . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,153.217

His Answer <P_154> was : <font> Oh that Language of Fiends , which was
so familiar to me , hangs yet about me : BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,154.218

Sure none has deserved more to be damned than I have done <$$font> .
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,154.219

And after he had humbly asked God Pardon for it , he desired me to call
the Person to him , that he might ask him forgiveness :
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,154.220

but I told him that was needless BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,154.221

for he had said it of one that did not hear it , and so could not be
offended by it . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,154.222

In this disposition of Mind did he continue all the while I was with him
, four days together ; BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,154.223

He was then brought so low that all hope of Recovery was gone .
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,154.224

Much purulent matter came from him with his Urine , which he passed
always with some pain ; But one day with unexpressible torment :
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,154.225

<P_155>

Yet he bore it decently , without breaking out into Repinings , or
impatient Complaints . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,155.227

He imagined he had a Stone in his Passage , BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,155.228

but it being searched , none was found . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,155.229

The whole substance of his Body was drained by the Ulcer ,
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,155.230

and nothing was left but Skin and Bone : BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,155.231

and by lying much on his Back , the parts there began to mortifie .
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,155.232

But he had been formerly so low , that he seemed as much past all hopes
of life as now ; which made him one Morning after a full and sweet
Nights rest , procured by Laudanum , given him without his knowledge ,
to fancy it was an effort of Nature , and to begin to entertain some
hopes of Recovery : BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,155.233

For he said , He felt himself perfectly well , and that he <P_156> had
nothing ailing him , but an extream weakness , which might go off in
time : BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,156.234

and then he entertained me with the Scheme he had laid down for the rest
of his life , how retired , how strict , and how studious he intended to
be : BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,156.235

But this was soon over , BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,156.236

for he quickly felt that it was only the effect of a good sleep , and
that he was still in a very desperate state .
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,156.237

I thought to have left him on <font> Friday <$$font> ,
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,156.238

but not without some Passion , he desired me to stay that day :
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,156.239

there appeared no symptome of present death ;
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,156.240

and a Worthy Physitian then with him , told me , That though he was so
low that an accident might carry him away on a suddain ; Yet without
that , he thought he might live yet <P_157> some Weeks .
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,157.241

So on <font> Saturday <$$font> , at Four of the Clock in the Morning I
left him , being the 24th of <font> July <$$font> .
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,157.242

But I durst not take leave of him ; BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,157.243

for he had expressed so great an unwillingness to part with me the day
before , that if I had not presently yielded to one days stay , it was
like to have given him some trouble , BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,157.244

therefore I thought it better to leave him without any Formality .
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,157.245

Some hours after he asked for me , BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,157.246

and when it was told him , I was gone , he seem'd to be troubled ,
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,157.247

and said , <font> Has my friend left me , BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,157.248

then I shall die shortly <$$font> . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,157.249

After that he spake but once or twice till he died :
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,157.250

He lay much silent : BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,157.251

Once they heard him praying very devoutly . BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,157.252

<P_158>

And on <font> Monday <$$font> about Two of the Clock in the Morning , he
died , without any <font> Convulsion <$$font> , or so much as a groan .
BURNETROC-1680-E3-H,158.254
