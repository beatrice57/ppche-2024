<td> <p>
The Cursor Mundi is a poem of 19,547 lines (in the Vespasian ms., the most
complete version) written almost entirely in short couplets, although other
types of lines appear in a few places.  It gathers together most of the
religious material of the time, consisting of a prologue and seven parts
which correspond to the Seven Ages of the World.  There are also some
further additions which appear in only some manuscripts.  Much of the
material is biblical but it also includes treatments of most religious
topics of any interest in its day.
