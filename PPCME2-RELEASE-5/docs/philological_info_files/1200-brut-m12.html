The following information was kindly supplied by Richard Zimmermann.
<blockquote>
Line 3 of the poem reads, "He [= Layamon] wonede at Ernleȝe" (now Areley
Kings) in Worcestershire.  The authorial dialect is therefore probably
West Midlands.  This dialect also has a high prior probability since
most Middle English texts from that time come from that region
(Katherine Group, Ancrene Riwle, Wooing Group, ...).  The text exists in
two manuscripts.  Cotton Caligula A.9 (1250-1300) is very likely also
West Midlands based on an investigation of "Owl and Nightingale."
However, the manuscript language is complex since it involves several
scribes copying from several exemplars with different writing systems.
It's not clear which scribe copied Layamon.  The second manuscript
Cotton Otho C.13 (1250-1300) has been localised to "NW Wilts" by LAEME
(http://archive.ling.ed.ac.uk/ihd/laeme2_scripts/search_cross_ref.php?fieldVal=London,%20British%20Library,%20Cotton%20Otho%20C%20xiii),
so it is more Southern.
