<h2>Information on the Katherine Group</h2>

<p> The precursor of the five texts in the Katherine Group (<i><a
href="cmsawles-m1.html">Sawles Warde</a>,</i> <a
href="cmhali-m1.html"><i>Hali Meidhad</a>,</i> <a
href="cmkathe-m1.html"><i>St.&nbsp;Katherine</a>,</i> <a
href="cmjulia-m1.html"><i>St.&nbsp;Juliana</a>,</i> <a
href="cmmarga-m1.html"><i>St.&nbsp;Margaret</a></i>) was written in the
same local literary standard as the precursor of the Corpus manuscript of
the Ancrene Riwle (referred to as AB from the sigla of the two mss.). There
is one hand throughout with some corrections in a different hand at the
beginning of <i><a href="cmmarga-m1.html">Margaret</a>.</i> The
scribe is generally thought to have been a literatim copyist who only
failed to write AB when his exemplar failed to provide it (<a
href="biblio.html#laing">Laing</a>).  </p>

<h3><a href="cmsawles-m1.html">Sawles Warde</a></h3>

<blockquote> The date of original composition is probably between 1200 and
1220, predating the <i>Ancrene Riwle</i>, but in the same textual
tradition, probably by the same author (<a
href="biblio.html#dobson">Dobson</a>).  It is &quot;an expanded and
dramatized translation of the <i>De Custodia Interioris Hominis (On the
Keeping of the Inner Self)</i> which was often attributed to (although it
is not by) St.&nbsp;Anselm of Canterbury, and which also circulated in the
Middle Ages as part of a lengthy compendium called <i>De Anima</i>,
sometimes erroneously attributed to Hugh of St.&nbsp;Victor&quot; (<a
href="biblio.html#savageandwatson">Savage and Watson</a>, p.&nbsp;210).  The
<a href="cmayenbi-m2.html"><i>Ayenbite of Inwyt</i></a> is ultimately
derived from the same source.  </blockquote>

<h3><a href="cmhali-m1.html">Hali Meidhad</a></h3>

<blockquote> <a href="biblio.html#dobson">Dobson</a> suggests
1210-1220 as the date of original composition, later than the other
Katherine Group works.  It is not based on any single work, but
&quot;contains material derived from Alan Lille's <i>Summa de Arte
Praidicatoria (The Art of the Preacher)</i>, and perhaps from Innocent
III's <i>De Miseria Humanae Conditionis (The Wretchedness of the Human
Condition)</i>&quot; (<a href="biblio.html#savageandwatson">Savage and
Watson</a>, p.&nbsp;223), among many others.  </blockquote>

<h3><a href="cmkathe-m1.html">St.&nbsp;Katherine</a></h3> 

<blockquote> <i><a href="cmkathe-m1.html">Katherine</a></i> always
appears together with <i><a href="cmsawles-m1.html">Sawles
Warde</a>.</i> It seems to share the same textual tradition and was
probably written around the same time (1200-1220).  It is also related to
the other saints' lives and particularly shares material with <i><a
href="cmjulia-m1.html">Juliana</a></i>.  Because <i><a
href="cmjulia-m1.html">Juliana</a></i> and <i><a
href="cmmarga-m1.html">Margaret</a></i> both have complicated textual
histories while <i><a href="cmkathe-m1.html">Katherine</a></i> does
not, it seems probable that the former predate the latter and influenced
its style, while <i><a href="cmkathe-m1.html">Katherine</a></i> in turn
influenced the Bodley ms. version of <i><a
href="cmjulia-m1.html">Juliana</a></i> (<a
href="biblio.html#savageandwatson">Savage and Watson</a>, based on <a
href="biblio.html#dobson">Dobson</a>). All three saints' lives possibly
predate <i><a href="cmhali-m1.html">Hali Meidhad</a>,</i> since it
mentions them, but as the saints were well known, this is not necessarily
the case.  </blockquote>

<h3><a href="cmjulia-m1.html">St.&nbsp;Juliana</a></h3> 

<blockquote> The Bodley text of <i><a
href="cmjulia-m1.html">Juliana</a></i> differs substantially from that
found in Royal, the other early manuscript.  It may be that the Bodley text
is an expansive revision of the original text, a translation of a popular
Latin life. The original translation probably predates <i><a
href="cmkathe-m1.html">Katherine</a></i>, but the Bodley version seems
to have been influenced by it.  </blockquote>

<h3><a href="cmmarga-m1.html">St.&nbsp;Margaret</a></h3>

<blockquote> <i><a href="cmmarga-m1.html">Margaret</a></i> is also
preserved in two somewhat different forms in the Bodley and Royal
manuscripts.  Its source is a popular Latin life &quot;whose origins are
still somewhat obscure&quot; (<a href="biblio.html#savageandwatson">Savage
and Watson</a>, p.&nbsp;428).  </blockquote>
