Lemmatization-related information
=================================

As noted in "Lemmatization" in the annotation guidelines for PPCHE
(<https://github.com/beatrice57/annotation-guidelines-for-ppche>),
lemmatized versions of the (Early) Modern English subcorpora of PPCHE
exist, but are not yet publicly available.  In the interim, we offer
three files with aggregate lemma frequencies for PPCEME and PPCMBE2,
sorted as follows:

* By lemma only
* By lemma, then form as it appears in the text
* By form, then lemma

Frequencies are tabulated separately for the two subcorpora.

* The column delimiter is (possibly multiple instances of) space.
* Forms are normalized with regard to case, with uppercase letters
  being replaced by and folded in with their lowercase counterparts.
* Forms are also normalized with regard to splitting indicated by "@".
  See the annotation guidelines
  (<https://github.com/beatrice57/annotation-guidelines-for-ppche>) for
  detsils.
* Apostrophes are not modified.
* Entries are sorted alphabetically.  The files may be sorted by
  frequency in a suitable application or by using the Unix command
  "sort" with suitable switches.
