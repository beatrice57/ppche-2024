Beneath the chalk range of Shakespeare's cliff , there is a bed of stiff
white clay containing nodules of radiating pyrites , which are scattered
over all the beach by the sea . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,2.18

I have found large masses of lustrous yellow pyrites <paren> in one
specimen formed upon a nodule of blue iron-stone <$$paren> .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,2.19

This mineral on the least exposure to the air is decomposed ,
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,2.20

the pyrites becomes dull , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,2.21

and falls into dust at a touch , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,2.22

and a yellow sulphureous efflorescence appears upon the fracture , not
on the exterior , which is usually renaform , and coated with brown
oxide of iron , which I have found likewise on the beach in large masses
, and sometimes even hematitic iron , and liver pyrites .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,2.23

Where a beach is composed of rolled flints , as the beaches on the south
<P_1,3> coast of England usually are , silex must now and then occur in
some of its more valuable forms . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,3.24

Accordingly , I have found two or three good specimens of pale milk_blue
chalcedony , and a fragment or two of cornelian {COM:sic} on Dover beach
, but only by a persevering search of an hour or two every day for more
than a month . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,3.25

Small crystals of quartz are very common everywhere in the cavities of
flint . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,3.26

Cyan. 6 . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,3.36

As we were going out of Calais , I noticed that the large plain , in
which that town is situated , is merely an extent of sea beach , being
for miles composed of loose rolled pebbles , in some places covered with
very thin vegetable soil which has been made capable of affording
nourishment to a little corn , but more frequently entirely bare ,
tossed into low hillocks , and having every appearance of having just
been abandoned by the ocean which deposited them there .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,3.37

The chalk downs between Calais and Boulogne run in long sweeping
eminences nearly to Montreuil , sometimes covered by a few beds of
gravel and clay . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,3.38

Clear and warm morning succeeded by thunder . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,3.45

In the evening there was much sheet lightning {TEXT:lightening} in the
east , playing continually . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,3.46

During the night there was a tremendous thunderstorm , the lightning
flashing ten or twelve times in a minute , and filling half the heaven
with a sheet of lurid blue flame at every flash , accompanied by
torrents of rain . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,3.47

Cyan. 7 . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,3.48

In the morning we walked round the ramparts , serenaded by the melodious
voices of a few thousands of frogs congregated in the half dried up moat
. RUSKIN-1835-1,1,3.49

Frogs have very strong voices in these warm countries
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,3.50

and take great delight in exercising them . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,3.51

Where the water was deeper and covered with reeds , we heard the cry of
a bird <paren> at least I supposed it to be so <$$paren> somewhat
resembling that of the corncrake , but more powerful , and shriller .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,3.52

I could not catch the least glimpse of the birds RUSKIN-1835-1,1,3.53

for they kept themselves concealed among the reeds .

RUSKIN-1835-1,1,3.58

The road from Abbeville to Rouen passes over a series of elevated plains
, intersected by considerable valleys {TEXT:vallies} ;
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,4.63

these high , but level chalk downs , on the approach to Rouen sink
suddenly down into a wide and richly cultivated plain which they
surround on three sides , but which spreads away towards the south in
uninterrupted distance . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,4.64

Round this champaign flows the Seine , skirting closely the bases of the
hills , which it has washed away in many parts into lofty chalk cliffs ,
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,4.65

and in the centre of the horse_shoe thus formed , at the bases of the
hills , and between them and the river , lies the town of Rouen , one of
the most beautiful out of all the beautiful cities of La belle France .

The road from Rouen is beautiful , passing for some distance under the
chalk cliffs , which , near Rouen , border the Seine .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,4.80

They are of a compact tolerably hard chalk , which supports itself in
many singular forms , very different from the monotonous slope of the
cliffs of Dover , by which however these cliffs are far exceeded in
height . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,4.81

Some distance from Paris the road passes over an immense sandstone tract
, which extends to a great distance in the direction of Fontainebleau
{TEXT:Fontainbleau} . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,4.104

It consists of low rounded hills covered in most parts with forest , but
here and there heaving up naked summits of grey rock , partially covered
with turf , from among the trunks of the tall trees by which they are
surrounded . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,4.105

The whole of this district , from here to Fontainbleau , is covered with
huge rounded blocks , apparently waterworn , of the sandstone by which
the hills themselves are composed . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,4.106

These masses lie tossed among the trunks of the ancient <P_1,5> trees ,
half buried in the turf , covered with moss , or tinted with various
lichens . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,5.107

I was at a loss to account for the appearance of a group of blocks lying
near the entrance of the forest . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,5.108

I mistook them at a distance for groups of gigantic Ammonites ,
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,5.109

and , indeed , even on a near approach could hardly believe them to be
simple blocks of Sandstone . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,5.110

Their surface was worn into the most grotesque shapes resembling knots
of serpents , or masses of aggregate fossils , and in some places even
annulated , like ammonites . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,5.111

But this structure did not extend into the interior of the stone .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,5.112

I broke several of the blocks , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,5.113

the sandstone was coarsegrained , and very soft , and on the fresh
fracture nearly of a pure white colour . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,5.114

It crumbles down very easily , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,5.115

and the result is a very fine white quartzose sand , with which the road
is a foot deep , where it passes through this part of the forest .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,5.116

None of the other blocks had this singular appearance , presenting only
the usual form of half flat , half rounded masses .

Walked about the environs of this beautiful village .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,5.134

The whole extent of country from Rheims to Bar le Duc is a plain : an
immense extent of level , but still of considerably elevated country .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,5.135

This is intersected by narrow valleys , whose richly cultivated meadows
are two or three_hundred feet below the level of the surrounding plains
, RUSKIN-1835-1,1,5.136

and in these vallies are situated the principal towns and villages of
this extensive district . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,5.137

' To enter a village ' is here a phrase synonymous with ' To go down
into a hole ' , and ' To leave a town ' with ' To go up a very steep
hill ' . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,5.138

Bar le Duc is situated in one of the largest of these beautiful vallies
, through which flows a small but rapid river . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,5.139

The high plains break down upon the valley in the form of immense and
regular bastions , whose summits are , of course , always flat <paren>
being part of the surrounding plain <$$paren> , and whose sides have a
very steep and regular slope . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,5.140

I could not perceive any correspondence between the angles of the hills
on the opposite sides of the valley . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,5.141

These hills are composed , as far as I could see , of loose and friable
loam covering beds of very hard grey limestone . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,5.142

The loam is mixed with broken fragments of stones , among which I found
, 1st , the limestone of which the hills are composed , in great
quantities . 2nd , a fine reddish flint with a few fossils . 3rd
<paren> of which I found only 4 specimens <$$paren> , a quartz rock with
fossils , <P_1,6> which I believed to be vegetables , in abundance , and
4th , a dark grey ironstone , with a few fossils .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,6.143

The sides of all these hills are covered with vineyards which produce
very good wine . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,6.144

The country from Bar le Duc has all the same character , of elevated
plain with intermediate valleys . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,6.149

In one , the ancient bed of a lake , the alluvial soil had been so
smoothly and evenly deposited as to be perfectly level <paren> to the
eye <$$paren> . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,6.150

I could not imagine how the river which passed through it knew which way
to run . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,6.151

From the top of a hill above Nancy the north Jura , or those chains of
mountains near Strasburg which run down to , and join the Jura , are
distinctly discernible . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,6.152

Above the village of Eppernel are some remarkable rocks of very thinly
stratified sandstone , which is exceedingly coarse_grained and of a
dirty red . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,6.163

Through the mass of this stone are dispersed large quartz pebbles which
may be easier broken than detached from their matrix .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,6.164

They give the rock the appearance of a real breccia .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,6.165

They are not found in every bed of the sandstone ; RUSKIN-1835-1,1,6.166

a few strata were entirely destitute of pebbles , though not differing
in other respects from the rest of the rock . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,6.167

I saw the rock on all sides , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,6.168

the beds were regularly deposited , and horizontal , or dipping very
slightly to the east . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,6.169

Cyan. 9 . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,6.184

Poligny is situated at the extremity of an immense plain and at the base
of the Jura . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,6.185

In most great ranges of mountains , the inferior chains , if they run
parallel to the great central one , have their backs <paren> so to speak
<$$paren> turned to the plains , and their escarpments towards the
central range . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,6.186

The Jura , though it does not run parallel to the Alps , is conformable
to this general rule . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,6.187

The Dole , and most other high peaks of the Jura , rise immediately from
the Pays de Vaud in steep grassy slopes , partly covered with forests of
pines , so that they may be seen from Geneva <P_1,7> from base to summit
. RUSKIN-1835-1,1,7.188

But on their northern side , they sink into elevated plains , or sloping
valleys , surmounted by summits of far inferior elevation , and which
gradually become lower as you approach the plains , ending in a long and
wide plain , which sinks suddenly into the cultivated champaigns of
France ; RUSKIN-1835-1,1,7.189

thus the highest summits of the Jura are not situated in the centre of
the range , but at its southern border , as in figure 1 , which a
transverse section of the range of the Jura might present .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,7.190

Poligny is situated at the foot of the first slope of the Jura , whose
rocks of gres are surmounted by blocks of grey granite , which present
an appearance of stratification , as decomposing granite very often does
, from splitting into regular fissures . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,7.191

{COM:picture_omitted} Past some very curious table beds of limestone ,
on the journey to Morez , a village situated in the centre of the Jura ,
between enormous rocks of magnesian limestone whose beds are in many
places nearly vertical , and have not been made so without being twisted
here and there in an extraordinary manner . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,7.192

Fig. 2 combines straight and curved beds , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,7.193

fig. 3 is remarkable for its reversed contortions .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,7.194

The <P_1,8> beds have commonly a dip of about 80@ @=o= .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,8.195

Hence we ascended by a steep gallery bordered by a precipice , to Les
Rousses RUSKIN-1835-1,1,8.196

and came suddenly in sight of the beautiful green heights of the Dole
jagged with pines , and varied by a few thin streaks of dazzling snow .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,8.197

The height at which perpetual snow commences on the Alps has been
variously stated . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,8.198

Ebel says at eight_thousand feet ; RUSKIN-1835-1,1,8.199

one of the monks of St. Bernard told me at six_thousand feet which , as
he most likely meant French feet , makes seven_thousand English .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,8.200

The actual height is very difficult to determine .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,8.201

This year the Jura had snow upon it in considerable quantities at the
end of June RUSKIN-1835-1,1,8.202

but it was after remarkably cold weather in the plains ,
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,8.203

and was not the winter snow remaining , but the remains of a fresh fall
, which frequently occurs in stormy weather even on such minor
elevations as these . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,8.204

When I saw the Jura in September their highest peaks <paren> 4,500
English {TEXT:Engsh} ft. <$$paren> were entirely free of snow .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,8.205

But on the high Alps snow is met with much lower , glaciers at
three_thousand feet , because they are continually supplied with fresh
ice and snow from the superior heights , and force their way into the
low valleys by their own weight , being of too considerable a mass to be
rapidly melted . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,8.206

Thus among the Alps you never see a mountain slightly capped with snow .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,8.207

If its height be less than about six_thousand English feet , it will
retain no snow during the summer ; RUSKIN-1835-1,1,8.208

if its elevation be greater , so as to render it capable of retaining a
little snow during summer , it will be coated with glacier to perhaps
two_thousand feet below its summit . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,8.209

From Les Rousses we past along the beautiful pasturages which extend
along the Jura from the base of the Dole , rich with a_thousand flowers
, dark with forest , or green with young corn , and dotted with detached
cottages , here and there sprinkled along the heights , or gathered into
small clusters . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,8.210

The hills became more peaked and more sprinkled with snow as we advanced
, until , after passing along an immense gallery , high upon the
precipices of the Dole , we turned that illustrious corner , that looks
across the broad and beautiful valley of Geneva to the eternal ramparts
of Italy , to the ' redoutables aiguilles ' and glittering aetherial
elevation of Mont Blanc . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,8.211

I have seen no view of it equal to this , yet . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,8.212

I believe the Breven is a little too near ; RUSKIN-1835-1,1,8.213

Sallanche is grand ; RUSKIN-1835-1,1,8.214

Ghamouni shows nothing of the height of Mont Blanc , which is quite
foreshortened when you look from such a near valley .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,8.215

No station shows the height and sublimity of the Alps so well as an
elevation of two_thousand or three_thousand feet at a distance of about
eighty or sixty miles , especially if you get a good sunset .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,8.216

The sky , at the highest part of the pass <paren> 3,000 ft. <$$paren> ,
was about 18 of the cyanometer , the air fresh , but not cold , the sun
hot , a light haze <P_1,9> about the horizon . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,9.217

The distance from the plains of France to this highest part of the pass
is about fifty-seven miles , the descent to the plain of Geneva about
ten . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,9.218

mountains . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,9.219

The colour of this river appears to me to vary with the season .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,9.227

When I was here in September , it was of an indigo blue colour ,
especially when you looked upon it with your back to the sun .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,9.228

I was afterwards much surprised to hear it called by many people ' sea
green . ' RUSKIN-1835-1,1,9.229

Now it appears to me of a much paler blue than it did later in the
season . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,9.230

It is , certainly , a steady blue tinge in the water ,
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,9.231

for all the stones at the bottom look blue through it .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,9.232

How other rivers would look if they were equally clear , we can@ @not
tell , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,9.233

even this water does not look very blue where it is shallow .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,9.234

But the Rhine is green , not blue , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,9.235

and therefore there must be some cause , which tinges clear water in the
one case emerald green , in the other indigo blue .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,9.236

Mont Blanc was beautifully clear . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,9.237

Before it was ascended it was thought to be ice , not snow , which
blanched its summit , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,9.238

why I can@ @not tell , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,9.239

no ice could assume the sweeping , rolling , luxuriously wreathed
outline , which at once shows the depth , as well as the substance of
its mantle . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,9.240

The aiguilles look very low beside it . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,9.241

I think either their height must be over_estimated , or that of Mont
Blanc under_estimated . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,9.242

Argentière is said to be thirteen_thousand feet . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,9.243

Now Mont Blanc looks one third higher ; RUSKIN-1835-1,1,9.244

I should think Mon=r= de Saussure's estimate of seventeen_thousand feet
was more correct than the usual one of fifteen_thousand .

Cloudy and warm . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,9.253

Set off from Geneva on the Chamouni road at 6 o'clock .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,9.254

At first you pass over the wide plain of Geneva , composed of alternate
sand and rolled pebbles , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,9.255

and pass the base of the Salève , where its beds dip beneath the plain .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,9.256

The side of this precipitous hill next Mont Blanc , is covered with
forest or scattered plantations or beautifully <P_1,10> cultivated , and
sprinkled with cottages and chalets , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,10.257

and then a beautiful and wide view opens , showing the conical rise of
the Mole and the woody slopes of the Voirons and the jagged crests of
the Brézon and the Mont du reposoir , which fall back to heights
sprinkled with snow , and to the dazzling triple peaks of Mont Blanc .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,10.258

Perhaps the best point of view is from the top of a hill which descends
into a deep ravine to a bridge across a torrent which joins the Arve .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,10.259

It has worn its way far down , through steeply inclined limestone beds ,
which are covered by about a_hundred feet of debris , composed of sand ,
rolled pebbles of all sizes , and huge blocks of granite .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,10.260

This debris is one confused mass , not disposed in beds .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,10.261

There is a very fine bridge thrown over the torrent .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,10.262

Hence you pass for a small distance along the plain ,
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,10.263

and then skirt the Base of the Mole , as you enter the valley of
Bonneville . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,10.264

This mountain , a long and regular ridge , presents its end to Geneva ,
and its long steep side to Bonneville , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,10.265

and separates two transverse valleys , which run at right angles to the
chain of the Alps , the one of which is bounded by the Brézon , the
other by the Voirons . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,10.266

The limestone beds of the Mole appear from Bonneviile to be horizontal :
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,10.267

whether they are or not I can@ @not say ; RUSKIN-1835-1,1,10.268

it requires to see strata on two sides at least , before you can
determine if they dip at all , and on many before you can tell what the
dip is . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,10.269

Against these apparently horizontal beds are raised huge buttresses of
vertical beds , slightly curved , {COM:picture_omitted} fig. 4 .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,10.270

They are of the same substance as the horizontal beds
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,10.271

and appear to have been torn from them , and forced into their vertical
position by some tremendous force from below . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,10.272

The Mole is only precipitous at its north_western extremity ;
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,10.273

opposite Bonneville it appears in green and beautiful heights , covered
at their base with pines . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,10.274

On the other side of Bonneville rises the Brézon in steps of alternate
turf and forest , and bare precipitous , inaccessible rock .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,10.275

It has no <P_1,11> snow , not being above four_thousand_five_hundred
feet above Mediterranean . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,11.276

I could not make out the direction of its beds or their substance ,
which however I suppose to be the same as that of the Mole .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,11.277

After passing through Bonneville and crossing the Arve , the road lies
through an immense alluvial plain , deposited by the Arve and not long
since subject to dreadful inundations from that river , as is shown by a
pillar erected at Bonneville to Charles {COM:blank_in_text} qui
aggeribus flumina coercuit . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,11.278

This plain is now beautifully cultivated , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,11.279

hops are grown in great quantities , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,11.280

and the road is shaded by long avenues of large and healthy fruit trees
. RUSKIN-1835-1,1,11.281

It is however subject to dreadful storms of wind , as most flat valleys
are if surrounded by lofty mountains . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,11.282

When we passed here in 1833 the hops were all laid flat on the ground ,
poles and all , by a late storm . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,11.283

And though subject to such attacks from air and water it is not exempt
from those of fire . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,11.284

In this plain as well as in one or two other parts of Switzerland , the
roots of the trees during an excessive drought took fire under_ground
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,11.285

and it was in vain that the peasants endeavoured to stop the devastation
by digging deep trenches and filling them with water .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,11.286

The mountains which surround this plain are all calcareous .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,11.287

After skirting their bases for some time you reach the village of Cluse
which is situated at the entrance of one of the most superb vallies or
rather ravines of the Alps , that of Maglan . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,11.288

It is bordered by enormous precipices of limestone , from eight_hundred
to two_thousand feet in height , veiled with pine forests of immense
extent ; above which rise peaks of enormous elevation , loaded with
dazzling snow , and broken into fantastic forms .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,11.289

Here the limestones begin first to yield to the clay and mica slates ,
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,11.290

here accordingly the mountains increase in elevation ,
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,11.291

lose the rounded sweeping outlines of the calcareous rocks ,
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,11.292

and break into tremendous precipices and singular peaks .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,11.293

The limestone beds on each side of this valley are confusedly disposed ,
sometimes curved , particularly at and near the Nant D'Arpenaz .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,11.294

After passing this cascade the road enters a much wider valley in which
is situated the village of Sallenche . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,11.295

This valley , where the mountains slope down into it , is beautifully
cultivated , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,11.296

but in its centre it is very flat , and subject to terrible devastation
from the floods of the Arve , which even when it is low flows in
a_hundred different channels , divided by wide beds of sand and gravel ,
with a few wild shrubs twisting their roots among them .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,11.297

These stony beds are perfect mineral treasuries , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,11.298

they are composed of specimens of every mountain in the course of the
Arve from the Col de Balme . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,11.299

1st . Large masses of clay slate , and very red mica slate with brown
mica : RUSKIN-1835-1,1,11.300

these come from the <P_1,12> mountains which extend from hence to Servoz
. RUSKIN-1835-1,1,12.301

These slates sometimes contain nodules and veins of quartz passing into
2nd . Foliated Granites whose composition is the same as those of true
granites but having the plates of mica disposed in parallel and
sometimes curved , folia , which gives the stone the appearance of being
thinly stratified which it is not : RUSKIN-1835-1,1,12.302

it does not even break in the direction of its folia rather than in any
other . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,12.303

These come from the hills near Servoz and from some of the aiguilles of
Chamouni . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,12.304

3rd . True Granites such as those of the Mont Blanc itself and of many
of its needles , coarse_grained , with chlorite instead of mica ,
sometimes in nests , sometimes with distinct veins of quartz .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,12.305

This is a white granite . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,12.306

That of the Midi , Blaitière , and most of the aiguilles near the
glacier du Bois and of the aiguilles rouges on the Mont Bréven is red ,
and I think foliated . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,12.307

4th . Quartz rock , in nodules very white , half crystallised , with
chlorite , compact , and of a dirty green . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,12.308

5th . Hornblende rock , which however is not plentiful .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,12.309

We arrived early at St. Martin . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,12.310

The summit of Mont Blanc was not clear , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,12.311

but the Dôme du Gouté {TEXT:here_and_throughout,_"Gouté"_for_"Goûter"}
and aiguille du Gouté were clear and beautifully lit up by the evening
sun , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,12.312

and the peaked outlines of the mountains round the valley rose
magnificently against a broad and lovely sunset .

Cleared up RUSKIN-1835-1,1,12.317

and we started . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,12.318

Past the fine bridge thrown over the Arve , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,12.319

and after crossing the plain for some distance began to wind up a steep
hill into the narrow defile which leads to Servoz .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,12.320

In these mountain valleys there is no gradual rise from the valley till
the hill becomes steep . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,12.321

The gravel and alluvial matter are deposited by water ,
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,12.322

and are as level as water RUSKIN-1835-1,1,12.323

and stop at the edge of the valley as sharply as water ,
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,12.324

and the hills dip down beneath them as they would beneath water .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,12.325

In fact so sudden is the change from plain to precipice that near Cluse
I saw a man lying sleeping with his head and shoulders comfortably
supported by the slope of the mountain and his feet and legs
delightfully deposited upon the level surface of the plain .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,12.326

Up the hill therefore , we wound among beautiful fruit trees ;
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,12.327

and entered a narrow defile between immense slaty mountains along which
rush or rather down which tumble the turbid waters of the Arve .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,12.328

At the top of the hill a small and beautifully clear streamlet enters a
small reservoir RUSKIN-1835-1,1,12.329

and forms a pretty little quiet pond , which is elevated to the dignity
of being called the lac de Chede . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,12.330

Its waters are beautifully clear RUSKIN-1835-1,1,12.331

and have a very slight but steady tinge of green .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,12.332

This tinge I should suppose to be an indication of the presence of
Copper . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,12.333

For the whole bottom of this lake is covered with a coat of <P_1,13>
bright verdigris blue , which however I could not get conveniently at ,
not liking to go over head and ears . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,13.334

The colour of this lake is quite different from that of the Rhone ,
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,13.335

for the latter is coloured RUSKIN-1835-1,1,13.336

but makes no deposit , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,13.337

and the former is very slightly coloured , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,13.338

yet deposits a strongly coloured sediment . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,13.339

I should have at once considered the waters of the Lac de Chede to be
cupriferous , had it not been for their excessive clearness , and for
the presence of numerous water serpents , one of which we caught as it
was twisting about among the grass and reeds near the shore , holding
its head well above water . About 14 inches long <paren> I believe
there are some nearly a yard <$$paren> , belly yellow , back yellow with
green chequers , head green with a yellow ring round its neck , and two
black triangular spots on the ring with their points directed down the
back . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,13.340

Said not to be venomous . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,13.341

No watersnakes are , indeed . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,13.342

This little lake is surrounded by beautiful trees ,
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,13.343

and its clear water reflects the summits of Mont Blanc , which are seen
far down the piny valley . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,13.344

After passing this lake the road winds along the side of high slaty
mountains at a great height above the ravines of the Arve .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,13.345

As you descend towards Servoz the summit of Mont Blanc sinks behind the
rounded mass of the Dôme du Gouté . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,13.346

Above Servoz there are yet seen the ruins which fell from an overhanging
mountain of mica slate . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,13.347

Three days the masses of stone continued falling RUSKIN-1835-1,1,13.348

and the dust was so great and so thick that at Turin it was supposed
that an immense volcano had broken out among the Alps .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,13.349

The whole side of the mountain is a ruin , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,13.350

but its fragments did not cover the valley like those of the Rossberg .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,13.351

After passing the village of Servoz you cross the Arve where it issues
from a deep and narrow ravine , cut right through the ridge which
separates the valley of Chamouni from that of Servoz .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,13.352

Over this ridge beside the ravine passes the road , over masses of
compact granites which certainly appear to be stratified .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,13.353

They are a good deal veined with quartz . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,13.354

From the summit of this ridge are first seen the green meadows of the
valley of Chamouni and the dark forests of the Bréven and Montanvert ,
and the peaks of the Glacier de Bosson , and the huge frozen waves of
Bois . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,13.355

After crossing the Arve a second time you arrive at the Prieure , which
is situated very nearly in the centre of the Valley of Chamouni and at
equal distances from its two principal Glaciers .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,13.356

Went to the source of the Arveiron in the afternoon , which is fine ,
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,13.357

but almost all glaciers have such an arch , that is they are all melting
below , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,13.358

and their water must find an outlet . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,13.359

The source in Argentière is very fine , in Bossons very poor , because
there are two or three others higher up . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,13.360

Morning cloudless . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,14.364

Mounted RUSKIN-1835-1,1,14.365

and off for Col de Balme . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,14.366

Crossed the Arve RUSKIN-1835-1,1,14.367

and past the Glacier du Bois . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,14.368

The Valley of Chamouni is divided into two distinct parts .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,14.369

The largest is that in which is situated the Prieuré and into which
descend the Glaciers of Bois , and of Bossons . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,14.370

But this valley is terminated near the Glacier de Bois , by a hill two
or three_hundred feet high , where cultivation appears to cease ;
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,14.371

yet after surmounting this hill another distinct but narrower valley
opens which is still called the valley of Chamouni and in which is
situated the village of Argentière . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,14.372

The pine-covered mountains on the south_eastern side of this valley
conceal upon your entrance the whole range of the aiguilles of Chamouni
, except the red granite of Midi and the white snowfields of Mont Blanc
. RUSKIN-1835-1,1,14.373

The valley however opens again towards Argentière , whose immense
glacier comes apparently rushing down the mighty valley between the huge
masses of the aiguilles Vertes and Argentière , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,14.374

and on the other side opens the ravine through which lies the passage of
the Tète noire . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,14.375

After this the mountains become sterile . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,14.376

The torrent descending from the Col de Balme has worn itself a channel
deep down among the slaty beds of that mountain which are here , and in
no other part , exposed . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,14.377

The slate does not lie in fine , compact , well formed beds such as I
have seen in Wales , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,14.378

but it is of a dirty black , and of a crumbling friable nature , falling
into small fragments and totally unfit for roofing , as is shown by the
houses in Chamouni being all roofed with wood . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,14.379

It is quarried , however , for another not less useful purpose , for
which it is peculiarly adapted . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,14.380

As the snow in Winter falls frequently three or four feet deep in the
valley of Chamouni , and gets frozen quite hard , it would not melt for
some time after the fine weather had commenced , and until it was too
late to sow corn . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,14.381

The peasants therefore spread this black and powdery slate in heaps over
the snow , which so increases and reflects the heat of the sun that the
snow is melted in a very short time . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,14.382

After passing this slate rock the mountain is covered with fine green
turf to the very summit , where we arrived at about 12 o'clock .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,14.383

The Col de Balme is a high ridge which separates the valley of Chamouni
from that of the Rhone in which is situated the village of Martigny .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,14.384

As it thus commands the Bernese Alps on the one Side , and the Glaciers
of Savoy on the other , there can@ @not be imagined a better observatory
, or a more magnificent panorama to be observed .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,14.385

Beginning with the Aiguilles of Chamouni , the two nearest are the
Aiguilles de Tour et d'Argentière . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,14.386

They are very perpendicular RUSKIN-1835-1,1,14.387

and are in consequence slightly sprinkled with snow .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,14.388

From their granite bases descends the beautiful glacier de Tours , which
is not <P_1,15> between high mountains in a steeply inclined ravine , as
most of the glaciers are , but spread out on the side of a broad hill ,
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,15.389

and therefore preserves the snow whiteness of its surface and the
beautiful blue of its Chasms unsullied by granite dust .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,15.390

Beyond these mountains and far above them , rises the Aiguille Verte ,
an excellent example of a structure very general among such granite
mountains . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,15.391

Its summit <font> a <$$font> fig. 5 , is , or appears to be , the
summit of an immense perpendicular {COM:picture_omitted} mass of solid
unstratifled granite tapering slightly to the top which is covered with
thick , white , and beautiful snow . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,15.392

On each side of this central mass are deposited huge folia of granite ,
those nearest to the centre being vertical , or nearly so , the next
more sloping , the slope increasing as the folia retire from the centre
. RUSKIN-1835-1,1,15.393

The tops of these side beds rise up in detached pointed peaks ,
frequently surrounding the aiguille like the leaves of a rose .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,15.394

Such a structure gave the Monte Rosa its name . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,15.395

One of these peaks on the aiguille Verte rises up in a beautiful and
regular pyramid <font> b <$$font> which from Chamouni appears higher
than the aiguille Verte , towering above the Mer de Glace under the name
of the Aiguille Dru . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,15.396

The rest of the Aiguilles of Chamouni can@ @not be separately
distinguished from the Col de Balme , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,15.397

for they are all lost in the huge mass of the Mont Blanc , from whose
near side they rise - jagged , black , snowless , perpendicular peaks ,
up , up , up one over another , Charmoz lost in Blaitière and Blaitière
in Midi , and Midi in the bright , dazzling summit which crowns the
whole . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,15.398

Mont Bianc is curiously regular in its form . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,15.399

Its summit is supported by three grand Buttresses , each of which have
two summits . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,15.400

They are seen best , one from Geneva , one from Sallenche , and the
other from the Col de Balme . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,15.401

That from Geneva has three peaks - Mont Blanc du Tacul , <P_1,16>
aiguille sans Nom , and Mont Blanc ; that from Sallenche three , and
that seen from the col de Balme three , the aiguille du Gouté , the Dôme
du Gouté , and the Mont Blanc . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,16.402

The first of these , which is the lowest , descends steeply into the
valley of Chamouni , which is seen lying along the base of Mont Blanc
with the Arve twisting about backwards and forwards among its green
meadows . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,16.403

To the right of this valley rise the Aiguilles Rouges of the Mont Bréven
. RUSKIN-1835-1,1,16.404

Their granite is very coarse_grained ; RUSKIN-1835-1,1,16.405

the plates of Mica are brown-red and very large .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,16.406

They are laid parallel to one another , thus rendering the granite
foliated , and so completely so that it looks like a mica slate .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,16.407

The forms of these aiguilles are beautiful , particularly from this
point . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,16.408

They are not very lofty , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,16.409

but they appear as if they were . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,16.410

To the right of these appears the Buet , a calcareous mountain .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,16.411

It presents its steep , precipice side to the col de Bahne and its
sloping side sheeted with snow to Geneva . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,16.412

This half of the panorama from the aiguille de Tour to the Buet was
cloudless , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,16.413

but over the Bernese Alps , which are almost all visible from the Col de
balme , over the Simplon , and the whole range of the high Alps ,
floated masses of thick white clouds - not rain clouds - which entirely
concealed the summits . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,16.414

The height at which the clouds float on a fine day causes them to crowd
about the mountain summits , continually tantalizing you with the view
of their bases . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,16.415

For though the vapour at the ordinary temperature of the air may be so
much diffused as not to be visible , yet it is often condensed by the
cold , when it approaches a snowy mountain , and becomes visible under
the form of a light white cloud , adhering closely to the summit .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,16.416

Such clouds I have watched for hours , hoping that they would pass away
because they were the only cloud in the sky , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,16.417

but though always in motion , these troublesome vapours keep continually
in the same place RUSKIN-1835-1,1,16.418

and conceal the summits far more effectually than rain clouds ,
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,16.419

for these latter are so low that they do not actually envelope the
summits , which they suffer you to see every now and then through their
openings . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,16.420

Accordingly all view in this direction was concealed by tantalizing
fairweather clouds . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,16.421

It was fortunate that they were confined to this quarter , and left the
Mont Blanc unobscured . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,16.422

At the Cabinet of Natural history on this mountain I obtained what I had
long wished for - a large octohedric crystal of rose fluor .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,16.423

Returned to Chamouni . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,16.424

And watched the sun go cloudlessly down upon Mont Blanc .

<font> July 9th . <$$font> RUSKIN-1835-1,1,16.426

Chamouni . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,16.427

This would have been a peculiar day in any climate , much more so among
mountains . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,16.428

From dawn till night there was not a single atom of a cloud to be found
out by the most telescopic <P_1,17> eye in the whole blue dome of the
sky ; not a mist nor a shadow . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,17.429

Off for Montanvert at 10 o'clock . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,17.430

The ascent begins very steeply zigzagging among blocks of granite and
mica slate , tossed about among pines of immense height , which twist
their long rough roots among the stones . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,17.431

Path , a series of stumbling blocks and staircases .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,17.432

Capital animals , these mules , marvellous , quite incomprehensibly
surefooted . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,17.433

You soon get to a great height above the prieuré RUSKIN-1835-1,1,17.434

and get two or three beautiful views of the valley of Chamouni .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,17.435

There is a curious specimen of natural grafting on this part of the road
. RUSKIN-1835-1,1,17.436

An immense pinetree has been torn up by the roots by a tempest ,
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,17.437

and as it was growing on a steep slope the root was lifted up in the air
and the top laid low on earth . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,17.438

Being however not totally torn from its moorings this root was capable
of affording nourishment to such seeds as might happen to fall on it
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,17.439

and it now presents the singular spectacle of five different trees
growing from one root with a large broken trunk projecting from the same
root downwards . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,17.440

I could not understand the French names of the trees ,
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,17.441

there were sapin and mélèze , both firs , beech , a broad_leaved shrub ,
and a tree resembling mountain ash . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,17.442

The Montanvert is chiefly composed of mica slate with quartz which is
rich in minerals . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,17.443

It has been deeply excavated near a small fountain about halfway up ,
where are found beautiful crystals of quartz in the cavities of the
veins ; and flexible asbestus <paren> amianthus <$$paren> in
considerable quantity . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,17.444

I found some good specimens growing , or rather appearing to grow , on a
piece of detached rock . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,17.445

Sometimes the amianthus is found twisted among and adhering to the
crystals of quartz , then forming very beautiful specimens .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,17.446

Chlorite is plentiful here in the quartz , as indeed every where in the
valley of Chamouni , and that , not in minute dark green crystals , such
as occupy the place of mica in Mont Blanc granites , but in large ,
compact , and beautiful masses . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,17.447

After passing this rock you come in view of the source of the Arveron
far below and of the precipices of ice which terminate the Mer de Glace
under the name of the glacier du Bois . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,17.448

These ice waves descend on one side in an unbroken sheet into the valley
, RUSKIN-1835-1,1,17.449

but on the other approach the top of a high and craggy precipice over
which they fall in loud avalanches , which you see and hear excellently
from the Montanvert . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,17.450

About this spot I found a crystal of quartz with Titanium .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,17.451

After a little more climbing you come in sight of the magnificent
pyramid of the aiguille Dru RUSKIN-1835-1,1,17.452

and then reach the brow of the montanvert . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,17.453

The glacier as it is seen from this spot , retiring backwards among
innumerable aiguilles , appears immense and wonderful ,
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,17.454

but as the near part of its surface is very flat it is by no means
<P_1,18> beautiful . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,18.455

But after advancing a little way towards the Jardin , the mountains and
blue precipices of ice become beautiful and astonishing , broken into
shelves and columns and perpendicular cliffs , with streams of green
water pouring in thunderous cascades into the chasms .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,18.456

The road towards the Jardin lies between the granite moraine , brought
down from the higher aiguilles , and highly inclined beds of mica slate
lying back in beautiful half_grassy slopes , with a few of the most
hardy species of pine clinging to their crests . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,18.457

Then you approach some steep stratified rocks , les Ponts , which you
have to cross in going to the Jardin . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,18.458

They were said to be calcareous , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,18.459

but I think that they , as well as most of the Montanvert , were
Composed of mica slate , or if not , of a foliated granite .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,18.460

And beyond this , all is granite , far as the eye can reach , a
wilderness of inaccessible peaks and unsullied snow , among which the
overhanging peak of the Geant , and elephant_like immensity of les
Jorasses , are pre-eminent . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,18.461

The Alpine rose grows on the Montanvert beautifully ,
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,18.462

but it is rather too low for it . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,18.463

On the passage of Splügen , at a height of eight_thousand feet , close
to the snow , yet sheltered from very cutting winds by superior
mountains , the whole breast of the hill blushed red with roses , heaped
like cushions upon the grey rocks - beautiful . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,18.464

The road to Chamouni is rather rough on the descent but very fine ,
affording beautiful views of the valley . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,18.465

Chamouni . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,18.468

To the Glacier des Bossons , which is far superior in beauty to the Mer
de Glace , broken into splendid pyramids of dazzling ice , quite free
from Granite dust . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,18.469

Its moraine however is very large , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,18.470

and all moraines are very ugly , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,18.471

for owing to the constant motion of the glacier the moraine is kept in
motion too , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,18.472

and in consequence not even grass can grow upon its moving mass .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,18.473

The great shoulder of Mont Blanc , the Dome du Gouté , which rises above
this glacier , is here the principal mountain , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,18.474

and a beautiful field of unbroken snow it is . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,18.475

The summer of 1834 was very hot here , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,18.476

the snows were very much melted , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,18.477

and in consequence a slip of snow has taken place on the Dome du Gouté
above the Glacier du Taconay , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,18.478

and an immense crevice has been formed , which enables you , even from
Chamouni , to judge of the depth of the snow on this magnificent
mountain . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,18.479

Its sides can@ @not be less than four_hundred feet of perpendicular
height RUSKIN-1835-1,1,18.480

and this is not glacier , but unfrozen snow or snow just so much frozen
as to be able to separate into crevices with perpendicular sides :
certainly not the dry and fine powder which I have seen rising from the
summit of Mont Blanc like dust , and which I took <P_1,19> at first for
a fine white cloud , till a guide told me it was a wind avalanche .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,19.481

Among these mountains , if the clouds in the morning be white , and have
a distinct outline , even although they are very small , and very high ,
and though they may not be numerous , yet they always increase fast ,
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,19.482

and rain follows in the afternoon , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,19.483

but though they may be large and even low , yet if they are of a rose
colour , and broken like spray , fading off into the sky with no outline
, they do not increase and usually entirely disappear towards the
evening . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,19.484

This day there were a few white clouds in the morning ;
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,19.485

they spread rapidly RUSKIN-1835-1,1,19.486

and came down about the middle of the day in a heavy shower .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,19.487

During a clear interval we walked up the side of the Bréven to a
considerable height , with Mont Blanc and the Line of aiguilles on the
opposite side of the valley pushing their pointed summits through the
rolling lines of cloud , breaking out among the vapour like visions
appearing in the heaven , with no relationship to the low earth , and
appearing higher and higher every step we went . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,19.488

Found some beautiful brown mica , and foliated granites , not chloritic
, RUSKIN-1835-1,1,19.489

and descended sorrowfully from the last walk , for this time , in
Chamouni . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,19.490

<font> July 11th . <$$font> RUSKIN-1835-1,1,19.491

St. Martin . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,19.492

Started just as the clouds broke that had been raining all the morning ,
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,19.493

and the blue sky looked out over the Dome du Gouté as we climbed the
hill which separates the valley of Chamouni from that of Servoz .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,19.494

The granite of which this hill is composed I found not to be foliated ;
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,19.495

it is compact , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,19.496

and contains little chlorite and much quartz . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,19.497

Breaking a piece in which were very large half crystals of quartz I
found two small grains of gold . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,19.498

The sand of the Arveiron contains a good deal of gold .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,19.499

I got some out of an eddy which was very fine , and in which I found
several grains . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,19.500

Instead of going directly to St. Martin we wound round the base of the
precipice which borders the valley of Sallenche to the north
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,19.501

and went to the baths of St. Gervais , which lie beneath cliffs of sand
, ferruginous , with alternate layers of pebbles about three_hundred
feet in height . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,19.502

They seem the remains of a deposit which must formerly have covered the
whole valley of Sallenche , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,19.503

for there is a hill of the same nature on the opposite side of the
valley , which would therefore present such a section as fig. 6 .
<font> a a , <$$font> gneiss with quartz veins <paren> which I saw
better afterwards <$$paren> ; RUSKIN-1835-1,1,19.504

beds dip to the north_west , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,19.505

and therefore appear horizontal , looking from the south east , <font> b
b , <$$font> beds of sand and pebbles , which are horizontal , appearing
to have been deposited during a long series of years by the peaceful
waters of some immense lake , and to have been swept away in their
centre by the current occasioned <P_1,20> when they retired , c , a
recent alluvium , deposited by the Arve . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,20.506

The mineral waters of St. Gervais are of two kinds :
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,20.507

the first spring is sulphureous , beautifully clear , and very warm ,
just cool enough to be drank . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,20.508

Within three yards of this spring rises another , perfectly cold , and
strongly impregnated with iron . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,20.509

The juxtaposition of the hot and cold springs is not singular ,
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,20.510

for a bed of iron pyrites may be supposed {COM:picture_omitted} to lie
very close to one of iron ochre . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,20.511

The former would furnish to the first spring its heat and its sulphur ,
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,20.512

and the red banks and steely taste of the latter spring at once show
over what mineral beds it flows . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,20.513

A rather severe shock of an earthquake was felt here ten days before we
arrived . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,20.514

The Bath house is situated in a narrow ravine opening into the valley of
Sallenche and echoing with the roar of a noisy torrent , which forms a
little higher up a very beautiful cascade ; RUSKIN-1835-1,1,20.515

but the place is sombre RUSKIN-1835-1,1,20.516

and I was glad to get out of it into the sunny valley of St. Martin .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,20.517

Out we went in the afternoon , up the dry bed of a torrent , which never
fails to bring you to something good , and indeed is very good
{COM:picture_omitted} in itself . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,20.518

After stumbling for some time over fragments of primitive rocks , I came
to a large piece of slate , thoroughly and beautifully coated with
stalactitic carbonate of lime , very hard , semi-translucent , and of a
fine yellowish brown colour . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,20.519

Where this fragment had come from I know not ; RUSKIN-1835-1,1,20.520

I found no more of it . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,20.521

I was soon stopped by a wall of rock , the site of a cascade -
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,20.522

only there was no water - RUSKIN-1835-1,1,20.523

but the rocks were very remarkable , hard , black , slaty rock , in
alternate beds with quartz , or rather alternate veins ,
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,20.524

for very few of the beds were more than three or four inches in
thickness . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,20.525

The quartz was very full of <P_1,21> cavities which were full of
beautiful but very small crystals . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,21.526

These beds were steeply inclined RUSKIN-1835-1,1,21.527

and where they were laid open at the cascade they had the appearance of
being curved , in a direction parallel to their planes , or rather ,
since this is impossible , of having been channelled by torrents of
falling water into their present form , that of a wall with semicircular
towers on it at irregular distances : fig. 7 . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,21.528

Correspondent strata appear on the opposite side of the valley near
Sallenche , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,21.529

but they are not channelled in this singular manner .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,21.530

The hills above Sallenche appear to be slate surmounted by what I
supposed to be limestone , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,21.531

but I can@ @not be sure . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,21.532

St. Gingolph . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,21.539

A lovely and burning day . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,21.540

Set off early for Bonneville . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,21.541

The curve of the crags over which falls the Nant d'Arpenaz is huge ,
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,21.542

but the depth of the curve is slight , while a little farther on there
are some contortions , on a smaller scale , but much more remarkable :
fig. 8 . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,21.543

This piece of rock is about thirty feet broad . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,21.544

After passing Bonneville and going some distance on the Geneva road , we
turned off for Thonon . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,21.545

From the brow of a hill on this road the view is splendid .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,21.546

On the right the Buet and its surrounding peaks , the Mont Blanc and its
aiguilles , the Môle , the Brezon and the Mont du Reposoir .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,21.547

In front the Voirons , and the summits of the Dents de Midi and de
Morcles , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,21.548

and on the left the blue waters of the lake of Geneva and the long hazy
line of the Jura . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,21.549

Our ride was beautiful during the whole day . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,21.550

After coming down upon the borders of the lake , and passing the
beautiful rocks of Meillerie , we arrived at St. Gingoulph , one of the
most beautiful villages on the lake of Geneva . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,21.551

<font> July 14th . <$$font> RUSKIN-1835-1,1,21.552

Martigny . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,21.553

Very fine . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,21.554

The rocks which you pass immediately after leaving St. Gingoulph are
exceedingly remarkable . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,21.555

The first are composed of calcareous tuffa , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,21.556

and are moistened by a_hundred dripping streamlets , which deposit their
carbonate of lime in beautiful translucent brown stalactites , which in
some places coat the original rock entirely ; RUSKIN-1835-1,1,21.557

some in the progress of formation , instead of being soft and crumbling
like lumps of brown sugar , as some stalactites are , were flexible ,
something like a rather tough paste . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,21.558

The rocks which are below this tuffa break out soon afterwards -
ironstone veined with quartz - in thin layers , divided by lamina of
indurated blue clay rendering the rock easily separable .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,21.559

In one piece I found a quartz vein pierced through by a long cylindrical
hole , quite filled with blue clay . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,21.560

<P_1,22>

Soon after passing these rocks the road leaves the beautiful borders of
the lake of Geneva to enter the flat and marshy plain deposited by the
Rhône where it enters the lake . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,22.562

The delta of this river continues to increase rapidly , as indeed it
must , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,22.563

for I have seldom seen a river more foul than the Rhöne at Sion ,
Martigny , &c. , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,22.564

and all this calcareous matter is continually being deposited by its
waters when they enter their resting place in the calm lake of Geneva .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,22.565

I would that the {COM:picture_omitted} land would not encroach any
farther : RUSKIN-1835-1,1,22.566

indeed it has encroached too much already . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,22.567

Deltas are most disagreeable things , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,22.568

for since from their nature they can@ @not rise above the level of the
water they remain marshy , low , half-cultivable lands , the causes of
ague in cold countries , and of malaria fever in warm .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,22.569

These marshes are at last terminated by the sudden closing of the valley
at St. Maurice , where a magnificent bridge strides over the compressed
Rhöne , and the raising of a drawbridge or the turning of a key would be
sufficient to shut you out from the whole Canton Valais .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,22.570

Passing under the huge overhanging rocks we entered the immense , and I
think beautiful valley , which is the only territory of one of the
largest cantons of Switzerland . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,22.571

The part of this valley which extends from St. Maurice to Martigny is
bordered on each side by huge limestone cliffs , which far outrival
{TEXT:rival} in beauty and singularity the rocky bulwarks of Cluse .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,22.572

These veteran crags remain , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,22.573

and will remain , telling to every traveller a wonderful tale of ancient
convulsions . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,22.574

Such coiled crags I never saw ; whole mountains twisted like macaroni ,
as if they had been tortured on the rack and broken on the wheel of the
world for ages . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,22.575

I sketched three dispositions , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,22.576

and could have had a_hundred , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,22.577

but these are sufficient for illustration . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,22.578

Fig. 9 is a crag just above St. Maurice , remarkable for the immense
scale of its contortions , since the height of this crag is <P_1,23> not
less than two_thousand feet perpendicular . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,23.579

The curve of this crag is rendered conspicuous at a glance by the
disposition of the pines , which grow in belts , upon the ledges formed
by the projection of the strata from beneath one another .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,23.580

Fig. 10 is a still more remarkable instance . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,23.581

It is a chain of calcareous peaks which you come in sight of
{COM:picture_omitted} on the right half way between St. Maurice and
Martigny . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,23.582

I was at first struck by their beautiful outline , which exactly
resembles that of a granite mountain , which indeed I should have
mistaken them for , had it not been for their finely marked strata .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,23.583

These , it will be observed , are not only curved but bent completely
round upon themselves {COM:picture_omitted} at <font> a , <$$font> being
perfectly straight both before and after this singular bend , and the
rest of the mountain bearing no traces of contortion .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,23.584

Below these peaks , rather nearer St. Maurice is a more isolated rock
whose beds are most singularly twisted : fig. 11 .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,23.585

These sketches are all taken from the rocks on the east side of the
valley . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,23.586

Those on the opposite one are much distorted , but not on so large a
scale . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,23.587

<P_1,24>

The cascade of the Pissevache near Martigny is a sort of split - the
difference between the immense body of water and small height of the
cataract of the Rhine , and the enormous height and dribbling stream of
the Nant D'Arpenaz . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,24.589

It is , I think , one of the finest falls in Switzerland , with its head
buried in spray , and its feet planted on the rainbow .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,24.590

These high cascades fall like reversed rockets in spear-points of water
, hissing as they come down . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,24.591

You can never judge of the height of cataracts by measuring them with
the eye : RUSKIN-1835-1,1,24.592

their body of water , or the height of the mountains or disposition of
the rocks around , all influence their apparent height .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,24.593

The only way by which I could ever judge was by observing the apparent
rapidity of the fall . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,24.594

Of course , the higher the cataract the slower the water appears to fall
: RUSKIN-1835-1,1,24.595

some high falls appear to walk down the rocks , while the low fall of
the Rhine seems to whiz by you like lightening . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,24.596

Hospice Of Great St. Bernard . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,24.598

Set off from Martigny on a cloudless morning . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,24.599

Crossed the bridge over the turbulent Drance , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,24.600

and plunged into a narrow defile , losing sight of the beautiful valley
of the Rhöne , and confined between immense slaty mountains , whose beds
, on the right side of the valley , at least , were principally vertical
, intersected here and there in a most remarkable manner by a horizontal
group so distinct from the rest as to resemble huge heaps of quarried
slate laid upon the side of the mountain . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,24.601

Through these rocks is cut the only gallery , or rather tunnel , on the
passage of the Great St. Bernard , which , however , is a long and
beautiful one . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,24.602

After passing this gallery the road rises rapidly , on rocks of gneiss ,
with here and there a block of quartz , with very much chlorite , and in
which I found two or three crystals of titanium .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,24.603

Up to Liddes the cornfields and cultivated meadowlands continue ,
although you quit the walnut and chestnut trees at five_hundred feet
above Martigny ; RUSKIN-1835-1,1,24.604

but every thing yields to pine forest and flowery mountain turf
immediately beyond Liddes . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,24.605

The rocks continue very monotonous - RUSKIN-1835-1,1,24.606

nothing but gneiss . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,24.607

We arrived early at L'Hospice . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,24.608

This convent is , I believe , the highest dwelling constantly inhabited
, in the known world , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,24.609

and a mournful habitation it is . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,24.610

It is situated in a narrow valley on the very highest part of the
passage , and close beside a small lake . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,24.611

The building is very substantial - no ornament - formerly supported by
immense buttresses , which a few years ago were taken down , and the
building totally renewed . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,24.612

There are three buildings : RUSKIN-1835-1,1,24.613

the first is a sort of storehouse ; RUSKIN-1835-1,1,24.614

then the principal building , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,24.615

and close to the hospice for the living is a narrow and small hut built
against the crags of Mont Mort , the dwelling place of the dead ;
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,24.616

and there the <P_1,25> bodies are laid side by side ,
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,25.617

and they perish not , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,25.618

for the cold blast of the day and the keen frost of the night are their
preservers . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,25.619

It is a strange museum , a revolting rare {TEXT:raree} show for every
chance comer to peep into , and wonder at , and come away from ,
complaining that he came before breakfast and has lost his appetite .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,25.620

The old bones might be let lie uncrunched by the thoughtless feet of
staring hundreds ; RUSKIN-1835-1,1,25.621

the corpses might be let sleep unoffended by their gaze .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,25.622

Above this melancholy habitation rise the crags of Mont Mort , loaded
with masses of thick snow . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,25.623

The grey steep rocks which remain uncovered are thinly greened with moss
and lichen to a certain height , the limit of all vegatation except that
of lichens . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,25.624

There is a dead stop ; RUSKIN-1835-1,1,25.625

the green bunches of moss cease suddenly , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,25.626

they flourish where they are , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,25.627

it is death to them to crawl an inch higher . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,25.628

This looks remarkable , seen from below ; RUSKIN-1835-1,1,25.629

the mosses coat the mountain like a belt RUSKIN-1835-1,1,25.630

and appear as green at the utmost limit of their territory as they do
far down . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,25.631

The line of demarcation is a foot or two higher on Mont Mort than on the
opposite crags , because that mountain has a south exposure .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,25.632

Above this line all is monotony , grey rocks , bare on the precipice
side , lifting up coronets of snow upon their foreheads , climbing up on
one anothers backs into the deep , blue , silent heaven , gathering
themselves around you on every side , gleaming in a pure , liquid
crystal , frosty sunlight or with their white summits shining out ,
themselves like suns , from oceans of invidious cloud , white misty
wreaths billowing beneath you , and whirling past you , and eddying
above you , like the wings of mountain spirits . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,25.633

Beneath the sloping flanks of Mont Mort , at about twelve feet below the
Hospice , rests a small , deep , calm , transparent lake .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,25.634

Ice is lighter than water , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,25.635

and I should suppose that snow , even when half melted , and thoroughly
penetrated with water , would float , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,25.636

and therefore I was surprised to see the snow in some places sloping
down beneath the water of this lake . RUSKIN-1835-1,1,25.637

It however was an excellent test of the colour of the water .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,25.638

It had not the bluish , verdigris green of the lac de Chêde , but a rich
olive sort of green , like the green of phosphate of copper .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,25.639

Nevertheless it is beautifully transparent , fed by snow water , chiefly
, and by two or three springs , one of which is conducted for more than
a quarter of a mile in pipes to supply the hospice .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,25.640

Its waters descend on the Aosta side , a tributary of the Po .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,25.641

Beyond this lake the valley appears to be terminated by peaks of gneiss
of a great elevation , sloping towards the mountains of Cormayeur ,
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,25.642

and on the Valais side the view is checked by the immense bulk of Mont
Velan , a series of dark aiguilles , connected by flat masses of snow .
RUSKIN-1835-1,1,25.643

When we were at the Hospice <paren> middle of July , <P_1,26> remember
<$$paren> the masses of snow around and beneath the hospice were
universal and large , RUSKIN-1835-1,1,26.644

but the heats of August and the beginning of September usually melt
almost entirely , sometimes altogether , the snow in this valley .
