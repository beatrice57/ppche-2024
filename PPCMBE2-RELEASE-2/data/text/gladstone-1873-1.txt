Jan 2 . 1873 . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,368.5

1. I telegraph to you this forenoon my assent to the rather absurd
surtaxe d' entrepôt . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,368.6

2. Yesterday I sent you a private letter which Elliot had written to me
about the Bulgarian Schism . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,368.7

I can@ @not help fearing that that schism may become a source of
political danger as it will bring in Russia to meddle in the religious
concerns of the Turkish Empire under the plea of ecclesiastical
communion . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,368.8

Being thus <P_2,369> dangerous it is also if I am rightly informed a
quarrel without any fair ground of difference ; as I understand that the
Patriarch of Constantinople who was wrong at the outset has been willing
for some time to grant the Bulgarians their independence of his ordinary
jurisdiction , but asks some territorial delimitation of the Bulgarian
Church & its inmunities . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,369.9

If this be the case the demand is so reasonable that I am at a loss to
conceive how it could be evaded : GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,369.10

on its being granted , or agreed to be granted , the excommunication
ought to be rescinded & peace re-established .
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,369.11

Sir H. Elliot's language & conduct seem to me most reasonable .
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,369.12

An attempt at an accommodation may be regarded as lying beyond his
ordinary attributions . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,369.13

But I wish something could be done . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,369.14

3. I have read your letter to Paget about Borneo & the Italian Prison
proposed to be founded there . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,369.15

I am rather behindhand in my information GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,369.16

but I did not know that we had properly speaking territorial rights in
Borneo . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,369.17

The plan may be bad GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,369.18

but if they think it good it would seem that <font> somewhere <$$font>
they ought to be able to do that which France & for all I know other
countries are still doing , & which we in my opinion were obliged to
abandon only because we had so ludicrously overdone it .
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,369.19

In the inclosed tract , sent to me by Sir E. Freshfield , you will find
an interesting account of the Bulgarian affair .

I think Kennedy's references home in the matter of French Treaty are
either a little over or a little underdone . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,369.25

This morning I had a draft about woollen duties with a request to reply
' approve ' or ' wait ' while the box is marked ' Pressing ' .
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,369.26

In the explanatory paper I find no material whereupon to found a real
judgment . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,369.27

It seems to me that where he and the Delegates from the Chambers are
agreed he may safely proceed - & that where they are not agreed the
<font> degree {COM:missing_comma} nature <$$font> and <font> reasons
<$$font> of the difference between them should be clearly stated & that
reference without this is little better than futile in matters which are
not of policy or principle but of the purest technical detail .
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,369.28

2. I send you herewith for perusal a letter from Biddulph on H. M.'s
behalf about Prince Leopold , and copy of my reply .
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,369.29

3. I also send Lord Russell's two last . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,369.30

You will see that he has in some degree relapsed .
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,369.31

I had asked him , in view of probable discussions on the Alabama
business , to let us know generally what line he would suggest our
taking about himself . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,369.32

Ja 3 . 73 . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,370.36

1. Audience question with China . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,370.37

I have read much about its postponement or its acceleration , & about
what we or others should do on it ; GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,370.38

but I never recollect to have read a reasoned statement of the merits of
the case <font> pro <$$font> & <font> con <$$font> , and especially of
the arguments which are or might be made by the Chinese against it .
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,370.39

The very first thing for us to do I think is to get this .
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,370.40

The question is not one of the self-evident class
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,370.41

and among other things may be borne in mind - a. That the dignity of
Foreign Powers may be impaired rather than promoted , if the forms of
presentation should assume a certain character .
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,370.42

I observe that prostration is contemplated by Mr Wade as a part of them
. GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,370.43

b. Considering that this matter seems to be regarded as a first class
question in China , I rather hesitate to agree to Mr Wade's demand that
we should decide simply whether the audience is to be pressed for , and
leave the manner to the joint action of the Ministers there .
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,370.44

Mr Wade himself deserves much confidence I believe ,
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,370.45

but as to the diplomatic corps at Pekin I am not so sure .
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,370.46

b. {COM:sic} The danger of being tripped up by the Russians is I think
grave . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,370.47

If they have a territorial question alive with China in all likelihood
it is much more important to <font> them <$$font> than this matter of
the Audience , GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,370.48

and they will work accordingly , and <font> sell <$$font> the common
demand for the particular advantage of which they are in quest .
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,370.49

c. Mr Wade describes the matter as urgent GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,370.50

but I do not see why - GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,370.51

We surely have very little to complain of as a nation in the conduct of
the Chinese through a series of years . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,370.52

It is not the practical conduct of business that seems to be in question
but some sort of symbolic manifestation . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,370.53

This surely will bear at least the lapse of time sufficient to let us
know what is to be pressed for , & why . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,370.54

In conclusion I must say that I do not quite appreciate the frightful
grievance that all these diplomatists appear to have suffered in having
the announcement of the Marriage conveyed to them <font> together
<$$font> with the request that foreigners should not come into the line
of the procession . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,370.55

It <font> may <$$font> have been wrong : GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,370.56

but for all I can see there might have been a counter-grievance , if the
marriage had been announced & the intimation reserved for a separate and
subsequent communication when the Chinese might have been told they had
forfeited their right to restrict the free movement of foreigners by not
exercising it at the proper time . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,370.57

1. Your account of Schouvaloff and of his communication is very
agreeable . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,371.62

I am sorry to miss him . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,371.63

2. I can see no objection to your asking Clarendon and Vernon - or
Aberdeen <P_2,372> in case of need . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,372.64

He has entered the Carlton but as I understand on an assurance from G.
Hamilton that it meant nothing political ! GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,372.65

3. I hope measure will be observed in talking about the poor Emperor's
fidelity to England . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,372.66

It was a matter of policy ; and of feeling subordinate to policy .
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,372.67

<font> How <$$font> subordinate it was we had proofs enough ; most of
all the Benedetti business , which no one wished to bring into the
notice it deserved , and of the disgrace of which certainly France & I
presume therefore Napoleon bears much more than half .
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,372.68

4. Those interesting but most sad letters from Spain suggest one or two
observations . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,372.69

They are strangely unfortunate in having to bring in so to speak their
Puerto Rico Bill & then adjourn for three weeks .
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,372.70

In this country , when matters were in our small way critical , we
should regard this as certain death to a measure & a ministry .
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,372.71

Again what can be more left-handed than to provide that the emancipation
shall take place at a certain time <font> after <$$font> an event of
which they may not be masters viz. publication in the Island Gazette .
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,372.72

reference to the passing of the Act in Spain .

1. With regard to Ld O. Russell's letter on the anti_English feeling
at Berlin . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,372.80

He seems to found it on the preposterous charge about Arms , in which it
seems they think they have a case . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,372.81

Why should we not invite a general conference of nations , either
including America or without her if she would not sit to discuss the
question without prejudice - to have submitted to it the cases in which
during the recent wars complaints have been made as to the supply of
arms and to inquire whether any impediment ought to be placed in its way
. GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,372.82

I do not see that inconvenience could well arise from such an
international commission so to call it , while there would I should
think be decided advantage in our proposing it , if the Cabinet thought
fit . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,372.83

2. I read Gen. Walker's report inclosed in the Dispatch with greater
interest than any one I have ever seen from him .
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,372.84

Of course it will go to Cardwell . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,372.85

I have always understood that our Staff Arrangements and Appointments
were by far the most expensive in the world . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,372.86

Lowe told me the other day he found there were three Colonels over
Netley Hospital ! GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,372.87

As to details Cardwell has been a great <P_2,373> deal too much & too
well employed in great matters to be responsible for all that was done
in the strange business called our Army reorganisation in 1855 & the
subsequent years . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,373.88

I can hardly suppose General Walker right in his facts :
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,373.89

if he were so it would be a sad disgrace to us .
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,373.90

As to the German invasion it would pull down that nation very much , at
least in my opinion , if they thought of it as a practical or
practicable business except in the case of some combination of all
Europe against us which is not an easy one to conceive .
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,373.91

But they are quite right to include our little country in their
exercises . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,373.92

I dare say it will not make you very nervous if some energetic pupil
demonstrates the mode in which even Walmer Castle might be taken .
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,373.93

3. The Parliamentary aspects of the central parts of our Irish Univ.
plan rather improve to my eye as I gradually try to acquire a closer
acquaintance with this very large subject . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,373.94

assume to suit you unless you telegraph by Monday to the contrary .

I do not quite gather from your note received today or from the
accompanying draft <paren> or copy <$$paren> how or in what shape the
question of the Duke of Edinburgh's marriage to the Czarewna has revived
. GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,374.101

But this is not very material . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,374.102

The fact being so , I agree that the balance of reasons against any
attempt to interfere with it still subsists .
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,374.103

Indeed it is strengthened by the fact that the Duke himself is now by
three or four years farther advanced into manhood so as to have passed
beyond those periods of life to which any thing like restraint except in
the form of advice is principally applicable .
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,374.104

It is further strengthened , as far as appears , by the circumstance
that a <font> greater <$$font> amount of difficulty attends any other
course than was at the former period in full view .

grant before the House of Commons if the arrangement now apparently in
contemplation should take effect ; GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,374.106

to it . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,375.113

In the Prince it does not surprise me : GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,375.114

This note embodies a request made to me orally by Ld R. Grosvenor .

There seems to be a little mixture of the two questions 1. How far new
means of communication are desirable . 2. How far we are to give an
opinion as between this & other modes of providing them .

On the second question it is for us to say as little as possible .
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,385.266

Still it occurs to me that the Tunnel is free from an objection to the
Ferry plan viz. that it might give an excuse for a great naval harbour
on the French side at the narrowest point of the Channel .

interference regard with a friendly and lively interest all schemes
framed with this object and open to no just objection , which is the
case of the Tunnel . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,385.268

letters to Lowe . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,397.433

1. One thing I omitted to say yesterday in writing about Hartington -
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,399.453

I feel he has been unjustly dealt with as to the G. P. O.
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,399.454

Monsell seems never to have bestowed a thought in this matter upon any
body but himself - GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,399.455

and I considered that his return to the G. P. O. <paren> which as I
have told you I supposed would be otherwise agreeable - & this explains
the succinctness of my words in writing to him <$$paren> would be the
most emphatic assertion on our part at least that he had been wholly
free from blame in his administration there .
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,399.456

Had I dreamed of his preference for the B. of W. I should not have
closed that door so speedily . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,399.457

GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,399.458

I do not see what you could have said more or better than you have said
. GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,399.470

We are in truth surprised all round . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,399.471

I will not discuss any question about complaint .
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,399.472

The question is what is best to be done . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,399.473

Circular correspondences on these matters are difficult to conduct
satisfactorily to an issue . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,399.474

I think that the best way will be to let these matters lie over until
the October meeting and that this had better follow Oct. 1 as closely
as may be . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,399.475

I regret Bessborough's strong language about Cowper ; and even more
about <P_2,400> Forster . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,400.476

Cowper's antecedents are certainly far better than those of Abercorn :
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,400.477

and to call Forster a gorilla simply shows unacquaintance with him , &
with the secret of his strength , GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,400.478

for strength undoubtedly he has . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,400.479

It would be very unfortunate , & would indeed be a strong measure , that
Spencer & Hartington , if they go , should go at the same moment like
Siamese . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,400.480

If you agree about postponement perhaps you will work in that sense .
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,400.481

In personal nearness there will at any rate be less risk of the rather
ridiculous misunderstandings which have marked this last series of

GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,401.495

The Queen evidently means him a jobation . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,401.496

The Queen is very desirous now that the ex_Duke of Brunswick is dead
that progress should if possible be made in the matter of securing that
succession to the son of the King of Hanover {TEXT:Hannover} by way of
compensation for the titular succession to his Father which he would
resign , GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,401.497

Bismarck as the incarnation of evil seems to be the impediment , with
the Crown Prince and Princess behind him . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,401.498

It is a great misfortune if he is governed by a mania of centralisation
and absorption . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,401.499

The Queen is quite satisfied with Lord Odo about this matter .
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,401.500

She is on the other hand afraid of her daughter's views in politics & in
religion . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,401.501

that of the native princes in India : where I for one am on the side of
those who wish not to absorb . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,401.502

to say at once that if his view is altered as to his resignation , I
hope he will stay . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,402.527

If I feel the delay till October to be desirable as to Hartington , it
is from no dissatisfaction , but because though unpledged there are

I do not see , after long conversations with the Queen , that it is

It seems to me , and the Queen is strong in this sense , that the matter
is not likely to be readily adjusted except by personal conference

Lowe's speech at Sheffield is really too bad ,

But I hold that the first duties of C. of E. are outside the Treasury
. GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,407.626

One of these is to look after & controul the great expenditures &
Estimates . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,407.627

In this duty I am sorry to say he was wretchedly deficient :
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,407.628

yet he coolly takes to himself the credit of Army & Navy reductions

case of the Ironclads - & thus open a way of escape from a serious
though I hope a temporary difficulty . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,408.646

<font> Before <$$font> I got the facts about the Deerhound I had been
inclining to the following conclusions . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,408.647

1. Loyalty <paren> <font> loyauté <$$font> <$$paren> binds us to
restore the ships if the Spanish Govt is really able or presumably able
to receive them . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,408.648

2. That being so it would be unworthy to be deterred by rebel threats
at Carthagena . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,408.649

3. These threats should be met by sending to that place <font> all
<$$font> the British Naval force we can collect for the occasion .

I hope it was in time . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,410.678

The main points are the two first . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,410.679

1. As to Peerages please to read Wolverton's letter within .
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,410.680

I do not say we ought permanently to stay our hand ;
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,410.681

{TEXT:+L30000} of 15 miles of Railway for the contingency of our
deciding to invade South Africa . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,410.684

I had already stated the need of information about this business for the

we have never had any I think except a few sentences <font> vivâ_voce .
<$$font> GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,410.686

And I have told Cardwell that if it be necessary to proceed in this
matter now , I do not feel able to do it without a Cabinet .
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,410.687

At such a Cabinet Bright should if possible be present -
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,410.688

and I <font> may <$$font> therefore have to ask you to get an earlier
day fixed for the Council than we had contemplated .
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,410.689

3. The Chancellor evidently took the right point about the Deerhound
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,410.690

but it is fortunate for us that the Spanish Government are so
unreasonable . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,410.691

offence . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,411.710

My view of him is I think the same as yours .
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,411.711

There is every likelihood that he may yet have to pass from 10 to 20
years in the House of Commons ; GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,411.712

and his role there ought to be a very important one with his excellent
brother F. to back him . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,411.713

I hope my Telegram was in time this morning to remove the
misapprehension <P_2,412> into which I had misled you .
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,412.714

I write however rather at a venture on this point ;
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,416.803

he will know whether for his statutory duties an absolute continuity in

I think the great object for the moment should be to obtain time if
possible for a thorough examination . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,417.825

1. Mr Wood's case is not fully before me . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,417.826

I do not know his character , GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,417.827

& much depends upon this . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,417.828

Upon the surface , his language to the Bey savours as much of dictation

. GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,417.829

2. De Broglie alleges that he sought the concession originally for
himself . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,417.830

Is he now free from all pecuniary interest in the matter ?
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,417.831

3. The remonstrance is stated by the Bey of Tunis in his note to have
been addressed to him by the Consuls generally and the Traders of the
place . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,417.832

This statement from such a source tells strongly against peremptory
action of any kind . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,417.833

5. I find nothing in the papers to explain the strange stipulation for
' preference ' to this English Bank . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,417.835

It is an ominous and inauspicious word on which it would seem that
almost any claim might be founded . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,417.836

For all these reasons I am very glad that by the Telegram of the 17th
you have directed Mr Wood to press for time .

One point of difficulty seems to be the determination of the degree in
which the letter of the Prime Minister pledges the Government or rather
the Bey . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,417.838

This would be plain enough here . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,417.839

Wolverton has set out the reasons <font> for <$$font> in the case of
Hugessen ; GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,420.870

I am sorry to say they do not at all satisfy me .
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,420.871

1. Nothing but <font> necessity <$$font> should lead us to open a
ministerial seat to which any doubt can attach .
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,420.872

W. gives a favourable opinion but with " I think " .
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,420.873

2. The P. O. with its huge & growing establishment {TEXT:estabt}
requires a real economist . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,420.874

I own I have never seen a sign of this in H. GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,420.875

3. He is a good fellow , a clever fellow , a very good speaker ;
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,420.876

but he has the P. C. given him very lately -
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,420.877

another step wd now be quite gratuitous , GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,420.878

& he like Baxter has never earned a reputation as a hard worker .
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,420.879

4. A gratuitous promotion in his case is the more questionable ,
because he very needlessly ran amuck at the Dissenters .
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,420.880

5. Two important appts are voided by a Scot & an Irishman -
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,420.881

it is hardly desirable to make upon this two important appts both of
Englishmen . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,420.882

In or among these considerations I find more than enough reason for a
negative after thinking the matter over . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,420.883

I send a copy of them to Wn GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,420.884

& I telegraphed to you both this morning - GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,420.885

I send his letter . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,420.886

Your cover which reached me today covered two letters dated the <font>
21st <$$font> . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,421.891

On one of the subject I have already written .
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,421.892

With regard to the other , the Russian fortune , you will judge better
than I can whether there should be any thing in the Treaty .
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,421.893

But it does not seem to me out of the question .
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,421.894

Whatever is given in a marriage settlement should be placed at the ready
and easy command of the married pair , GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,421.895

and the G. D.'s fortune should be as accessible as the dividends on the
Russian Funds , subject to any reasonable charge , if there be occasion
. GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,421.896

But at any rate I should think full subsidiary provision should be made
contemporaneously with the Treaty . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,421.897

I have named the 10th at 3 for the Cabinet . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,421.898

Having no answer to my Telegram of Monday morning I sent off yesterday
from London an offer of the P. O. to Baxter .
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,421.902

There may I fear have been some mischance in the dispatch of your reply
which came here today <paren> Wednesday <$$paren> afternoon .
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,421.903

Nothing could be more unfortunate than the breaking up when we were
separated of the understanding arrived at <font> vivâ_voce <$$font> with
Wolverton ; GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,421.904

for it is almost impossible , in nice cases , to settle these things
properly by letter , GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,421.905

& for us , under present circumstances , every case is a nice case .
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,421.906

I am afraid the Monarchists in France are mad :
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,421.907

they seem to have hitched themselves into a position when it is a
disgrace to recede & disaster of the highest order to advance .
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,421.908

<P_2,422>

We shall not be at Althorp till Friday of next week .
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,422.910

I could hardly hope that the Sec.ship of B. of Trace would have any
attractions for your brother , remarkable as I know his modesty to be .

Oct 31 . 73 . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,422.914

I am I assure you extremely concerned at the failure of my little plot
against your brother : GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,422.915

& he ' heaps coals of fire on my head ' by the way in which he takes it
. GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,422.916

I did not change my mind about the suggestion ,
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,422.917

but only gave way to his modest unwillingness .
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,422.918

On the other hand it is really necessary , in the present state of Civil
Service agitation for increase of pay , to put a man firm in such
matters to the P. O. GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,422.919

and such I think Baxter will be - GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,422.920

but I have no idea whether he will accept . GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,422.921

I have not yet heard from you whether you accept <font> Erle <$$font> in
lieu of James - it appearing that his health is quite adequate , & the
Chancellor having on this ground altered his preference .
GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,422.922

What a letter of Chambord's , GLADSTONE-1873-1,2,422.923

and what an explosion of a grand conspiracy against liberty !
