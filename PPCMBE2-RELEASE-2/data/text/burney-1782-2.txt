Chap. VIII . BURNEY-1782-2,1,101.4

An Opera Rehearsal . BURNEY-1782-2,1,101.5

<$$heading>

The next day , between eleven and twelve o'clock , Mr. Monckton was
again in Portman-square ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,101.7

he found , as he expected , both the ladies , BURNEY-1782-2,1,101.8

and he found , as he feared , Mr. Arnott prepared to be of their party
. BURNEY-1782-2,1,101.9

He had , however , but little time to repine at this intrusion , before
he was disturbed by another , BURNEY-1782-2,1,101.10

for , in a few minutes , they were joined by Sir Robert Floyer , who
also declared his intention of accompanying them to the Haymarket .
BURNEY-1782-2,1,101.11

Mr. Monckton , to disguise his chagrin , pretended he was in great
haste to set off , lest they should be too late for the overture :
BURNEY-1782-2,1,101.12

they were , therefore , quitting the breakfast room , when they were
stopt by the appearance of Mr. Morrice . BURNEY-1782-2,1,101.13

The surprise which the sight of him gave to Mr. Monckton was extreme ;
BURNEY-1782-2,1,101.14

he knew that he was unacquainted with Mr. Harrel ,
BURNEY-1782-2,1,101.15

for he remembered they were strangers to each other when they lately met
at his house ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,101.16

he concluded , therefore , that Cecilia <P_1,102> was the object of his
visit , BURNEY-1782-2,1,102.17

but he could frame no conjecture under what pretence .
BURNEY-1782-2,1,102.18

The easy terms upon which he seemed with all the family by no means
diminished his amazement ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,102.19

for when Mrs. Harrel expressed some concern that she was obliged to go
out , he gaily {TEXT:gally} begged her not to mind him , assuring her he
could not have stayed two minutes , and promising , unasked , to call
again the next day : BURNEY-1782-2,1,102.20

and when she added , " We would not hurry away so , only we are going to
a rehearsal of an Opera , " he exclaimed with quickness , " A rehearsal
! BURNEY-1782-2,1,102.21

- are you really ? BURNEY-1782-2,1,102.22

I have a great mind to go too ! " BURNEY-1782-2,1,102.23

Then , perceiving Mr. Monckton , he bowed to him with great respect ,
BURNEY-1782-2,1,102.24

and enquired , with no little solemnity , how he had left lady Margaret
, BURNEY-1782-2,1,102.25

hoped she was perfectly recovered from her late indisposition ,
BURNEY-1782-2,1,102.26

and asked sundry questions with regard to her plan for the winter .
BURNEY-1782-2,1,102.27

This discourse was ill constructed for rendering his presence desirable
to Mr. Monckton ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,102.28

he answered him very drily , BURNEY-1782-2,1,102.29

and again pressed their departure . BURNEY-1782-2,1,102.30

" O , " cried Morrice , " there@ @'s no occasion for such haste ;
BURNEY-1782-2,1,102.31

the rehearsal does not begin till one , " BURNEY-1782-2,1,102.32

<P_1,103>

" You are mistaken , Sir ! " said Mr. Moncton ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,103.34

" it is to begin at twelve o'clock . " BURNEY-1782-2,1,103.35

" O ay , very true , " returned Morrice ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,103.36

" I had forgot the dances , BURNEY-1782-2,1,103.37

and I suppose they are to be rehearsed first . BURNEY-1782-2,1,103.38

Pray , Miss Beverley , did you ever see any dances rehearsed "
BURNEY-1782-2,1,103.39

" No , Sir . " BURNEY-1782-2,1,103.40

" You@ @'ll be excessively entertained , then , I assure you .
BURNEY-1782-2,1,103.41

It@ @'s the most comical thing in the world to see those signores and
signoras cutting capers in a morning . BURNEY-1782-2,1,103.42

And the <font> figuranti <$$font> will divert you beyond measure ;
BURNEY-1782-2,1,103.43

you never saw such a shabby set in your life : BURNEY-1782-2,1,103.44

but the most amusing thing is to look in their faces ,
BURNEY-1782-2,1,103.45

for all the time they are jumping and skipping about the stage as if
they could not stand still for joy , they look as sedate and as dismal
as if they were so many undertakers men . " BURNEY-1782-2,1,103.46

" Not a word against dancing ! " cried Sir Robert ,
BURNEY-1782-2,1,103.47

" it@ @'s the only thing carries one to the Opera ;
BURNEY-1782-2,1,103.48

and I am sure it@ @'s the only thing one minds at it . "
BURNEY-1782-2,1,103.49

The two ladies were then handed to Mrs. Harrel's <font> vis-à-vis
<$$font> ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,103.50

and the gentlemen , joined without further ceremony by Mr. Morrice ,
followed them to the Hay-market . BURNEY-1782-2,1,103.51

The rehearsal was not begun , BURNEY-1782-2,1,103.52

and Mrs. Harrel and Cecilia secured themselves a <P_1,104> box upon the
stage , from which the gentlemen of their party took care not to be very
distant . BURNEY-1782-2,1,104.53

They were soon perceived by Mr. Gosport , who instantly entered into
conversation with Cecilia . BURNEY-1782-2,1,104.54

Miss Larolles , who with some other ladies came soon after into the next
box , looked out to courtsie and nod , with her usual readiness , at
Mrs. Harrel , BURNEY-1782-2,1,104.55

but took not any notice of Cecilia , though she made the first advances
. BURNEY-1782-2,1,104.56

" What@ @'s the matter now ? " cried Mr. Gosport ;
BURNEY-1782-2,1,104.57

" have you affronted your little prattling friend ?
BURNEY-1782-2,1,104.58

" Not with my own knowledge ; " answered Cecilia ;
BURNEY-1782-2,1,104.59

" perhaps she does not recollect me . " BURNEY-1782-2,1,104.60

Just then Miss Larolles , tapping at the door , came in from the next
box to speak to Mrs. Harrel ; with whom she stood chatting and laughing
some minutes , without seeming to perceive that Cecilia was of her party
. BURNEY-1782-2,1,104.61

" Why what have you done to the poor girl ? " whispered Mr. Gosport ;
BURNEY-1782-2,1,104.62

" did you talk more than herself when you saw her last ? "
BURNEY-1782-2,1,104.63

" Would that have been possible ? " cried Cecilia ;
BURNEY-1782-2,1,104.64

" however , I still fancy she does not know me . "
BURNEY-1782-2,1,104.65

She then stood up , which making Miss <P_1,105> Larolles involuntarily
turn towards her , she again courtsied ; a civility which that young
lady scarce deigned to return , before , bridling with an air of
resentment , she hastily looked another way , and then , nodding
good-humouredly at Mrs. Harrel , hurried back to her party .
BURNEY-1782-2,1,105.66

Cecilia , much amazed , said to Mr. Gosport , " See now how great was
our presumption in supposing this young lady's loquacity always at our
devotion ! " BURNEY-1782-2,1,105.67

" Ah madam ! " cried he , laughing , " there is no permanency , no
consistency in the world ! no , not even in the tongue of a voluble !
BURNEY-1782-2,1,105.68

and if that fails , upon what may we depend ? " BURNEY-1782-2,1,105.69

" But seriously , " said Cecilia , " I am sorry I have offended her ,
and the more because I so little know how , that I can offer her no
apology . " BURNEY-1782-2,1,105.70

" Will you appoint me your envoy ? BURNEY-1782-2,1,105.71

Shall I demand the cause of these hostilities ? "
BURNEY-1782-2,1,105.72

She thanked him , BURNEY-1782-2,1,105.73

and he followed Miss Larolles ; who was now addressing herself with
great earnestness to Mr. Meadows , the gentleman with whom she was
conversing when Cecilia first saw her in Portman-square .
BURNEY-1782-2,1,105.74

He stopt a moment to let her finish her speech , which , with no little
spirit , <P_1,106> she did in these words , " I never knew any thing
like it in my life ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,106.75

but I sha'@ @n't put up with such airs , I assure her ! "
BURNEY-1782-2,1,106.76

Mr. Meadows made not any other return to her harangue , but stretching
himself with a languid smile and yawning : BURNEY-1782-2,1,106.77

Mr. Gosport , therefore , seizing the moment of cessation , said , "
Miss Larolles , I hear a strange report about you . "
BURNEY-1782-2,1,106.78

" Do you ? " returned she , with quickness , BURNEY-1782-2,1,106.79

" pray what is it ? BURNEY-1782-2,1,106.80

something monstrous impertinent , I dare say , BURNEY-1782-2,1,106.81

- however , I assure you it i'@ @n't true . " BURNEY-1782-2,1,106.82

" Your assurance , " cried he , " carries conviction indisputable ,
BURNEY-1782-2,1,106.83

for the report was that you had left off talking . "
BURNEY-1782-2,1,106.84

" O , was that all ! " cried she , disappointed ,
BURNEY-1782-2,1,106.85

" I thought it had been something about Mr. Sawyer ,
BURNEY-1782-2,1,106.86

for I declare I have been plagued so about him , I am quite sick of his
name . " BURNEY-1782-2,1,106.87

" And for my part , I never heard it ! BURNEY-1782-2,1,106.88

so fear nothing from me upon his account . " BURNEY-1782-2,1,106.89

" Lord , Mr. Gosport , how can you say so ? BURNEY-1782-2,1,106.90

I am sure you must know about the festino that night ,
BURNEY-1782-2,1,106.91

for it was all over the town in a moment . " BURNEY-1782-2,1,106.92

" What festino ? " BURNEY-1782-2,1,106.93

" Well , only conceive how provoking ! BURNEY-1782-2,1,106.94

- why , I know nothing else was talked of for a month . "
BURNEY-1782-2,1,106.95

<P_1,107>

" You are most formidably stout this morning ! BURNEY-1782-2,1,107.97

it is not two minutes since I saw you fling the gauntlet at Miss
Beverley , BURNEY-1782-2,1,107.98

and yet you are already prepared for another antagonist . "
BURNEY-1782-2,1,107.99

" O as to Miss Beverley , I must really beg you not to mention her ;
BURNEY-1782-2,1,107.100

she has behaved so impertinently , that I do@ @n't intend ever to speak
to her again . " BURNEY-1782-2,1,107.101

" Why , what has she done ? " BURNEY-1782-2,1,107.102

" O she@ @'s been so rude you@ @'ve no notion . BURNEY-1782-2,1,107.103

I@ @'ll tell you how it was . BURNEY-1782-2,1,107.104

You must know I met her at Mrs. Harrel's the day she came to town ,
BURNEY-1782-2,1,107.105

and the very next morning I waited on her myself ,
BURNEY-1782-2,1,107.106

for I would not send a ticket , because I really wished to be civil to
her ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,107.107

well , the day after , she never came near me , though I called upon her
again ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,107.108

however , I did not take any notice of that ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,107.109

but when the third day came , and I found she had not even sent me a
ticket , I thought it monstrous ill bred indeed ;
BURNEY-1782-2,1,107.110

and now there has past more than a week , BURNEY-1782-2,1,107.111

and yet she has never called : BURNEY-1782-2,1,107.112

so I suppose she do@ @n't like me ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,107.113

so I shall drop her acquaintance . " BURNEY-1782-2,1,107.114

Mr. Gosport , satisfied now with the subject of her complaint ,
returned to Cecilia , BURNEY-1782-2,1,107.115

and informed her of the heavy charge which was brought against her .
BURNEY-1782-2,1,107.116

" I am glad , at least , to know my crime , " said she ,
BURNEY-1782-2,1,107.117

" for otherwise I should <P_1,108> certainly have sinned on in ignorance
, as I must confess I never thought of returning her visits :
BURNEY-1782-2,1,108.118

but even if I had , I should not have supposed I had yet lost much time
. " BURNEY-1782-2,1,108.119

" I beg your pardon there , " said Mrs. Harrel ;
BURNEY-1782-2,1,108.120

" a first visit ought to be returned always by the third day . "
BURNEY-1782-2,1,108.121

" Then have I an unanswerable excuse , " said Cecilia ,
BURNEY-1782-2,1,108.122

" for I remember that on the third day I saw her at your house . "
BURNEY-1782-2,1,108.123

" O that@ @'s nothing at all to the purpose ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,108.124

you should have waited upon her , or sent her a ticket , just the same
as if you had not seen her . " BURNEY-1782-2,1,108.125

The overture was now begun , BURNEY-1782-2,1,108.126

and Cecilia declined any further conversation . BURNEY-1782-2,1,108.127

This was the first Opera she had ever heard , BURNEY-1782-2,1,108.128

yet she was not wholly a stranger to Italian compositions , having
assiduously studied music from a natural love of the art , attended all
the best concerts her neighbourhood afforded , and regularly received
from London the works of the best masters . BURNEY-1782-2,1,108.129

But the little skill she had thus gained , served rather to increase
than to lessen the surprise with which she heard the present performance
, - a surprize of which the discovery of her own ignorance made not the
least part . BURNEY-1782-2,1,108.130

Unconscious from the little she had acquired how much was to be learnt ,
she was astonished to find the inadequate <P_1,109> power of written
music to convey any idea of vocal abilities : BURNEY-1782-2,1,109.131

with just knowledge enough , therefore , to understand something of the
difficulties , and feel much of the merit , she gave to the whole Opera
an avidity of attention almost painful from its own eagerness .
BURNEY-1782-2,1,109.132

But both the surprize and the pleasure which she received from the
performance in general , were faint , cold , and languid , compared to
the strength of those emotions when excited by Signore Pacchierotti in
particular ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,109.133

and though not half the excellencies of that superior singer were
necessary either to amaze or charm her unaccustomed ears , though the
refinement of his taste and masterly originality of his genius , to be
praised as they deserved , called for the judgment and knowledge of
professors , yet a natural love of music in some measure supplied the
place of cultivation , BURNEY-1782-2,1,109.134

and what she could neither explain nor understand , she could feel and
enjoy . BURNEY-1782-2,1,109.135

The opera was Artaserse ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,109.136

and the pleasure she received from the music was much augmented by her
previous acquaintance with that interesting drama ;
BURNEY-1782-2,1,109.137

yet , as to all noviciates in science , whatever is least complicated is
most pleasing , she found herself by nothing so deeply impressed , as by
the plaintive and beautiful simplicity with <P_1,110> which Pacchierotti
uttered the affecting repetition of <font> sono innocente ! <$$font>
BURNEY-1782-2,1,110.138

his voice , always either sweet or impassioned delivered those words in
a tone of softness , pathos , and sensibility , that struck her with a
sensation not more new than delightful . BURNEY-1782-2,1,110.139

But though she was , perhaps , the only person thus astonished , she was
by no means the only one enraptured ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,110.140

for notwithstanding she was too earnestly engaged to remark the company
in general , she could not avoid taking notice of an old gentleman who
stood by one of the side scenes , against which he lent his head in a
manner that concealed his face , with an evident design to be wholly
absorbed in listening : BURNEY-1782-2,1,110.141

and during the songs of Pacchierotti he sighed so deeply that Cecilia ,
struck by his uncommon sensibility to the power of music , involuntarily
watched him , whenever her mind was sufficiently at liberty to attend to
any emotions but its own . BURNEY-1782-2,1,110.142

As soon as the rehearsal was over , the gentlemen of Mrs. Harrel's
party crowded before her box ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,110.143

and Cecilia then perceived that the person whose musical enthusiasm had
excited her curiosity , was the same old gentleman whose extraordinary
behaviour had so much surprized her at the house of Mr. Monckton .
BURNEY-1782-2,1,110.144

Her desire to obtain some information concerning him again reviving ,
<P_1,111> she was beginning to make fresh enquiries , when she was
interrupted by the approach of Captain Aresby . BURNEY-1782-2,1,111.145

That gentleman , advancing to her with a smile of the extremest
self-complacency , after hoping , in a low voice , he had the honour of
seeing her well , exclaimed , " How wretchedly empty is the town !
petrifying to a degree ! BURNEY-1782-2,1,111.146

I , believe you do not find yourself at present <font> obsedé <$$font>
by too much company ? " BURNEY-1782-2,1,111.147

" <font> At present <$$font> , I believe the contrary ! " cried Mr.
Gosport . BURNEY-1782-2,1,111.148

" Really ! " said the captain , unsuspicious of his sneer , " I protest
I have hardly seen a soul . BURNEY-1782-2,1,111.149

Have you tried the Pantheon yet , ma'am ? " BURNEY-1782-2,1,111.150

" No , Sir . " BURNEY-1782-2,1,111.151

" Nor I ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,111.152

I do@ @n't know whether people go there this year .
BURNEY-1782-2,1,111.153

It is not a favourite <font> spectacle <$$font> with me ;
BURNEY-1782-2,1,111.154

that sitting to hear the music is a horrid bore .
BURNEY-1782-2,1,111.155

Have you done the Festino the honour to look in there yet ? "
BURNEY-1782-2,1,111.156

" No , Sir . " BURNEY-1782-2,1,111.157

" Permit me , then , to have the honour to beg you will try it . "
BURNEY-1782-2,1,111.158

" O , ay , true , " cried Mrs. Harrel ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,111.159

" I have really used you very ill about that ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,111.160

I should have got you in for a subscriber : BURNEY-1782-2,1,111.161

but Lord ; I have done nothing for you yet , BURNEY-1782-2,1,111.162

<P_1,112>

and you never put me in mind . BURNEY-1782-2,1,112.164

There@ @'s the ancient music , and Abel's concert ;
BURNEY-1782-2,1,112.165

- as to the opera , we may have a box between us ;
BURNEY-1782-2,1,112.166

- but there@ @'s the ladies concert we must try for ;
BURNEY-1782-2,1,112.167

and there@ @'s - O Lord , fifty other places we must think of ! "
BURNEY-1782-2,1,112.168

" Oh times of folly and dissipation ! " exclaimed a voice at some
distance ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,112.169

" Oh mignons of idleness and luxury ! BURNEY-1782-2,1,112.170

What next will ye invent for the perdition of your time !
BURNEY-1782-2,1,112.171

How yet further will ye proceed in the annihilation of virtue ! "
BURNEY-1782-2,1,112.172

Every body stared ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,112.173

but Mrs. Harrel cooly said , " Dear , it@ @'s only the man-hater ! "
BURNEY-1782-2,1,112.174

" The man-hater ? " repeated Cecilia , who found that the speech was
made by the object of her former curiosity ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,112.175

" is that the name by which he is known ? " BURNEY-1782-2,1,112.176

" He is known by fifty names , " said Mr. Monckton ;
BURNEY-1782-2,1,112.177

" his friends call him the <font> moralist <$$font> ; the young ladies ,
the <font> crazy-@ @man <$$font> ; the macaronies , the <font> bore
<$$font> ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,112.178

in short , he is called by any and every name but his own . "
BURNEY-1782-2,1,112.179

" He is a most petrifying wretch , I assure you , " said the captain ;
BURNEY-1782-2,1,112.180

" I am <font> obsedé <$$font> by him <font> partout <$$font> ;
BURNEY-1782-2,1,112.181

if I had known he had been so near , I should certainly have said
nothing . " BURNEY-1782-2,1,112.182

" That you have done so well , " cried <P_1,113> Mr. Gosport , " that
if you had known it the whole time , you could have done it no better .
" BURNEY-1782-2,1,113.183

The captain , who had not heard this speech , which was rather made at
him than to him , continued his address to Cecilia ;
BURNEY-1782-2,1,113.184

" Give me leave to have the honour of hoping you intend to honour our
select masquerade at the Pantheon with your presence .
BURNEY-1782-2,1,113.185

We shall have but 500 tickets , BURNEY-1782-2,1,113.186

and the subscription will only be three guineas and a half . "
BURNEY-1782-2,1,113.187

" Oh objects of penury and want ! " again exclaimed the incognito ;
BURNEY-1782-2,1,113.188

" Oh vassals of famine and distress ! BURNEY-1782-2,1,113.189

Come BURNEY-1782-2,1,113.190

and listen to this wantonness of wealth ! BURNEY-1782-2,1,113.191

Come , naked and breadless as ye are , BURNEY-1782-2,1,113.192

and learn how that money is consumed which to you might bring raiment
and food ! " BURNEY-1782-2,1,113.193

" That strange wretch , " said the captain , " ought really to be
confined ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,113.194

I have had the honour to be <font> degouté <$$font> by him so often ,
that I think him quite obnoxious . BURNEY-1782-2,1,113.195

I make it quite a principle to seal up my lips the moment I perceive him
. " BURNEY-1782-2,1,113.196

" Where is it , then , " said Cecilia , " that you have so often met him
? BURNEY-1782-2,1,113.197

" O , " answered the captain , " <font> partout <$$font> ; there is no
greater bore about town . BURNEY-1782-2,1,113.198

But the time I found him most petrifying was once when I happened to
have the honour <P_1,114> of dancing with a very young lady , who was
but just come from a boarding-school , and whose friends had done me the
honour to fix upon me upon the principle of first bringing her out : and
while I was doing <font> mon possible <$$font> for killing the time , he
came up , and in his particular manner , told her I had no meaning in
any thing I said ! BURNEY-1782-2,1,114.199

I must own I never felt more tempted to be <font> enragé <$$font> with a
person in years , in my life . " BURNEY-1782-2,1,114.200

Mr. Arnott now brought the ladies word that their carriage was ready ,
BURNEY-1782-2,1,114.201

and they quitted their box : BURNEY-1782-2,1,114.202

but as Cecilia had never before seen the interior parts of a theatre ,
Mr. Monckton , hoping while they loitered to have an opportunity of
talking with her , asked Morrice why he did not <font> shew the lyons ?
<$$font> BURNEY-1782-2,1,114.203

Morrice , always happy in being employed , declared it was <font> just
the thing he liked best <$$font> , BURNEY-1782-2,1,114.204

and begged permission to do the honours to Mrs. Harrel , who , ever
eager in the search of amusement , willingly accepted his offer .
BURNEY-1782-2,1,114.205

They all , therefore , marched upon the stage , their own party now
being the only one that remained . BURNEY-1782-2,1,114.206

" We shall make a triumphal entry here , " cried Sir Robert Floyer ;
BURNEY-1782-2,1,114.207

" the very tread of the stage half tempts me to turn actor , "
BURNEY-1782-2,1,114.208

<P_1,115>

" You are a rare man , " said Mr. Gosport , " if , at your time of life
, that is a turn not already taken . " BURNEY-1782-2,1,115.210

" My time of life ! " repeated he ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,115.211

" what do you mean by that ? BURNEY-1782-2,1,115.212

do you take me for an old man ! " BURNEY-1782-2,1,115.213

" No , Sir , but I take you to be past childhood , and consequently to
have served your apprenticeship to the actors you have mixed with on the
great stage of the world , and , for some years at least , to have set
up for yourself . " BURNEY-1782-2,1,115.214

" Come , " cried Morrice , BURNEY-1782-2,1,115.215

" let@ @'s have a little spouting ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,115.216

't@ @will make us warm . " BURNEY-1782-2,1,115.217

" Yes , " said Sir Robert , " if we spout to an animating object .
BURNEY-1782-2,1,115.218

If Miss Beverley will be Juliet , I am Romeo at her service . "
BURNEY-1782-2,1,115.219

At this moment the incognito , quitting the corner in which he had
planted himself , came suddenly forward , BURNEY-1782-2,1,115.220

and <paren> standing before the whole group , cast upon Cecilia a look
of much compassion , BURNEY-1782-2,1,115.221

and called out , " Poor simple victim ! hast thou already so many
pursuers ? BURNEY-1782-2,1,115.222

yet seest not that thou art marked for sacrifice !
BURNEY-1782-2,1,115.223

yet knowest not that thou art destined for prey ! "
BURNEY-1782-2,1,115.224

Cecilia , extremely struck by this extraordinary address , stopt short
BURNEY-1782-2,1,115.225

and looked much disturbed : which , when he perceived , he added , " Let
the danger , not the <P_1,116> warning affect you !
BURNEY-1782-2,1,116.226

discard the sycophants that surround you , BURNEY-1782-2,1,116.227

seek the virtuous , BURNEY-1782-2,1,116.228

relieve the poor , BURNEY-1782-2,1,116.229

and save yourself from the impending destruction of unfeeling prosperity
! " BURNEY-1782-2,1,116.230

Having uttered these words with vehemence and authority , he sternly
passed them , BURNEY-1782-2,1,116.231

and disappeared . BURNEY-1782-2,1,116.232

Cecilia , too much astonished for speech , stood for some time
immoveable , revolving in her mind various conjectures upon the meaning
of an exhortation so strange and so urgent . BURNEY-1782-2,1,116.233

Nor was the rest of the company much less discomposed :
BURNEY-1782-2,1,116.234

Sir Robert , Mr. Monckton and Mr. Arnott , each conscious of their own
particular plans , were each apprehensive that the warning pointed at
himself : BURNEY-1782-2,1,116.235

Mr. Gosport was offended at being included in the general appellation
of sycophants ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,116.236

Mrs. Harrel was provoked at being interrupted in her ramble ;
BURNEY-1782-2,1,116.237

and Captain Aresby , sickening at the very sight of him , retreated the
moment he came forth , BURNEY-1782-2,1,116.238

" For heaven's sake , " cried Cecilia , when somewhat recovered from her
consternation , " who can this be , BURNEY-1782-2,1,116.239

and what can he mean ? BURNEY-1782-2,1,116.240

You , Mr. Monckton , must surely know something of him ;
BURNEY-1782-2,1,116.241

it was at your house I first saw him . ' BURNEY-1782-2,1,116.242

<P_1,117>

" Indeed , " answered Mr. Monckton , " I knew almost nothing of him
then , BURNEY-1782-2,1,117.244

and I am but little better informed now . BURNEY-1782-2,1,117.245

Belfield picked him up somewhere , BURNEY-1782-2,1,117.246

and desired to bring him to my house : BURNEY-1782-2,1,117.247

he called him by the name of Albany : BURNEY-1782-2,1,117.248

I found him a most extraordinary character , BURNEY-1782-2,1,117.249

and Belfield , who is a worshipper of originality , was very fond of him
. " BURNEY-1782-2,1,117.250

" He@ @'s a devilish crabbed old fellow , " cried Sir Robert ,
BURNEY-1782-2,1,117.251

" and if he goes on much longer at this confounded rate , he stands a
very fair chance of getting his ears cropt . " BURNEY-1782-2,1,117.252

" He is a man of the most singular conduct I have ever met with , " laid
Mr. Gosport ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,117.253

" he seems to hold mankind in abhorrence , BURNEY-1782-2,1,117.254

yet he is never a moment alone , BURNEY-1782-2,1,117.255

and at the same time that he intrudes himself into all parties , he
associates with none : BURNEY-1782-2,1,117.256

he is commonly a stern and silent observer of all that passes ,
BURNEY-1782-2,1,117.257

or when he speaks , it is but to utter some sentence of rigid morality ,
or some bitterness of indignant reproof . " BURNEY-1782-2,1,117.258

The carriage was now again announced , BURNEY-1782-2,1,117.259

and Mr. Monckton taking Cecilia's hand , while Mr. Morrice secured to
himself the honour of Mrs. Harrel's , Sir Robert and Mr. Gosport made
their bows BURNEY-1782-2,1,117.260

and departed . BURNEY-1782-2,1,117.261

But though they had now quitted the stage , and arrived at the head of a
small stair_case <P_1,118> by which they were to descend out of the
theatre , Mr. Monckton , finding all his tormentors retired , except
Mr. Arnott , whom he hoped to elude , could not resist making one more
attempt for a few moments conversation with Cecilia ;
BURNEY-1782-2,1,118.262

and therefore , again applying to Morrice , he called out , " I do@ @n't
think you have shewn the ladies any of the contrivances behind the
scenes ? " BURNEY-1782-2,1,118.263

{COM:missing_open_quote} True , " cried Morrice ,
BURNEY-1782-2,1,118.264

" no more I have ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,118.265

suppose we go back ? " BURNEY-1782-2,1,118.266

" I shall like it vastly , " said Mrs. Harrel ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,118.267

and back they returned . BURNEY-1782-2,1,118.268

Mr. Monckton now soon found an opportunity to say to Cecilia , " Miss
Beverley , what I foresaw has exactly come to pass ;
BURNEY-1782-2,1,118.269

you are surrounded by selfish designers , by interested , double-minded
people , who have nothing at heart but your fortune , and whose
mercenary views , if you are not guarded against them - "
BURNEY-1782-2,1,118.270

Here a loud scream from Mrs. Harrel interrupted his speech ;
BURNEY-1782-2,1,118.271

Cecilia , much alarmed , turned from him to enquire the cause ,
BURNEY-1782-2,1,118.272

and Mr. Monckton was obliged to follow her example :
BURNEY-1782-2,1,118.273

but his mortification was almost intolerable when he saw that lady in a
violent fit of laughter , and found her scream was only occasioned by
seeing Mr. Morrice , in his diligence to do the <P_1,119> honours ,
pull upon his own head one of the side scenes ! BURNEY-1782-2,1,119.274

There was now no possibility of proposing any farther delay ;
BURNEY-1782-2,1,119.275

but Mr. Monckton , in attending the ladies to their carriage , was
obliged to have recourse to his utmost discretion and forbearance , in
order to check his desire of reprimanding Morrice for his blundering
officiousness . BURNEY-1782-2,1,119.276

Dressing , dining with company at home , and then going out with company
abroad , filled up , as usual , the rest of the day .
BURNEY-1782-2,1,119.277

<P_1,120>

<heading>

Chap. IX . BURNEY-1782-2,1,120.280

A Supplication . BURNEY-1782-2,1,120.281

<$$heading>

The next morning Cecilia , at the repeated remonstrances of Mrs. Harrel
, consented to call upon Miss Larolles . BURNEY-1782-2,1,120.283

She felt the impracticability of beginning at present the alteration in
her way of life she had projected , BURNEY-1782-2,1,120.284

and therefore thought it most expedient to assume no singularity till
her independency should enable her to support it with consistency ;
BURNEY-1782-2,1,120.285

yet greater than ever was her internal eagerness to better satisfy her
inclination and her conscience in the disposition of her time , and the
distribution of her wealth , since she had heard the emphatic charge of
her unknown Mentor . BURNEY-1782-2,1,120.286

Mrs. Harrel declined accompanying her in this visit , because she had
appointed a surveyor to bring a plan for the inspection of Mr. Harrel
and herself , of a small temporary building , to be erected at
Violet-Bank , for the purpose of performing plays in private the ensuing
Easter . BURNEY-1782-2,1,120.287

When the street door was opened for her to get into the carriage , she
was struck with <P_1,121> the appearance of an elderly woman who was
standing at some distance , and seemed shivering with cold , and who ,
as she descended the steps , joined her hands in an act of supplication
, and advanced nearer to the carriage . BURNEY-1782-2,1,121.288

Cecilia stopt to look at her : BURNEY-1782-2,1,121.289

her dress , though parsimonious , was too neat for a beggar ,
BURNEY-1782-2,1,121.290

and she considered a moment what she could offer her .
BURNEY-1782-2,1,121.291

The poor woman continued to move forward , but with a slowness of pace
that indicated extreme weakness ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,121.292

and , as she approached and raised her head , she exhibited a
countenance so wretched , and a complection so sickly , that Cecilia was
impressed with horror at the sight . BURNEY-1782-2,1,121.293

With her hands still joined , and a voice that seemed fearful of its own
sound , " Oh madam , " she cried , " that you would but hear me ! "
BURNEY-1782-2,1,121.294

" Hear you ! " repeated Cecilia , hastily feeling for her purse , "
most certainly ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,121.295

and tell me how I shall assist you ? " BURNEY-1782-2,1,121.296

" Heaven bless you for speaking so kindly , madam ! " cried the woman ,
with a voice more assured ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,121.297

" I was sadly afraid you would be angry , BURNEY-1782-2,1,121.298

but I saw the carriage at the door , BURNEY-1782-2,1,121.299

and I thought I would try ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,121.300

for I could be no worse ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,121.301

and distress , madam , makes very bold . " BURNEY-1782-2,1,121.302

" Angry ! " said Cecilia , taking a crown <P_1,122> from her purse ,
BURNEY-1782-2,1,122.303

" no , indeed ! BURNEY-1782-2,1,122.304

- who could see such wretchedness , and feel any thing but pity ! "
BURNEY-1782-2,1,122.305

" Oh madam , " returned the poor woman , BURNEY-1782-2,1,122.306

" I could almost cry to hear you talk so , though I never thought to cry
again , since I left it off for my poor Billy ! "
BURNEY-1782-2,1,122.307

" Have you , then , lost a son ? " BURNEY-1782-2,1,122.308

" Yes , madam ; but he was a great deal too good to live ,
BURNEY-1782-2,1,122.309

so I have quite left off grieving for him now . "
BURNEY-1782-2,1,122.310

" Come in , good woman , " said Cecilia , BURNEY-1782-2,1,122.311

" it is too cold to stand here , BURNEY-1782-2,1,122.312

and you seem half starved already ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,122.313

come in , BURNEY-1782-2,1,122.314

and let me have some talk with you . " BURNEY-1782-2,1,122.315

She then gave orders that the carriage should be driven round the square
till she was ready , BURNEY-1782-2,1,122.316

and making the woman follow her into a parlour , desired to know what
she should do for her ; changing , while she spoke , from a movement of
encreasing compassion , the crown which she held in her hand for double
that sum . BURNEY-1782-2,1,122.317

" You can do every thing , madam , " she answered , " if you will but
plead for us to his honour : BURNEY-1782-2,1,122.318

he little thinks of our distress , because he has been afflicted with
none himself , BURNEY-1782-2,1,122.319

and I would not be so troublesome to him , BURNEY-1782-2,1,122.320

but indeed , indeed , madam , we are quite pinched for want ! "
BURNEY-1782-2,1,122.321

Cecilia , struck with the words <font> he little <P_1,123> thinks of our
distress , because he has been assisted with none himself <$$font> ,
felt again ashamed of the smallness of her intended donation ,
BURNEY-1782-2,1,123.322

and taking from her purse another half guinea , said " will this assist
you ? BURNEY-1782-2,1,123.323

Will a guinea be sufficient to you for the present ?
BURNEY-1782-2,1,123.324

" I humbly thank you , madam , " said the woman , curtsying low ,
BURNEY-1782-2,1,123.325

" shall I give you a receipt ? " BURNEY-1782-2,1,123.326

" A receipt ? " cried Cecilia , with emotion , " for what ?
BURNEY-1782-2,1,123.327

Alas , our accounts are by no means balanced ! BURNEY-1782-2,1,123.328

but I shall do more for you if I find you as deserving an object as you
seem to be . " BURNEY-1782-2,1,123.329

" You are very good , madam ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,123.330

but I only meant a receipt in part of payment . "
BURNEY-1782-2,1,123.331

" Payment for what ? BURNEY-1782-2,1,123.332

I do@ @n't understand you . " BURNEY-1782-2,1,123.333

" Did his honour never tell you , madam , of our account ? "
BURNEY-1782-2,1,123.334

" What account ? " BURNEY-1782-2,1,123.335

" Our bill , madam , for work done to the new Temple at Violet-Bank :
BURNEY-1782-2,1,123.336

it was the last great work my poor husband was able to do ,
BURNEY-1782-2,1,123.337

for it was there he met with his misfortune . " BURNEY-1782-2,1,123.338

" What bill ? BURNEY-1782-2,1,123.339

What misfortune ? " cried Cecilia ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,123.340

" What had your husband to do at Violet-Bank ? "
BURNEY-1782-2,1,123.341

" He was the carpenter , madam . BURNEY-1782-2,1,123.342

I <P_1,124> thought you might have seen poor Hill the carpenter there .
" BURNEY-1782-2,1,124.343

" No , I never was there myself . BURNEY-1782-2,1,124.344

Perhaps you mistake me for Mrs. Harrel . " BURNEY-1782-2,1,124.345

" Why sure , madam , a'@ @n't you his honour's lady ? "
BURNEY-1782-2,1,124.346

" No . BURNEY-1782-2,1,124.347

But tell me , what is this bill ? " BURNEY-1782-2,1,124.348

" 'T@ @is a bill , madam , for very hard work , for work , madam , which
I am sure will cost my husband his life ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,124.349

and though I have been after his honour night and day to get it , and
sent him letters and petitions with an account of our misfortunes , I
have never received so much as a shilling ! BURNEY-1782-2,1,124.350

and now the servants wo@ @n't even let me wait in the hall to speak to
him . BURNEY-1782-2,1,124.351

Oh madam ! you who seem so good , plead to his honour in our behalf !
BURNEY-1782-2,1,124.352

tell him my poor husband can@ @not live ! BURNEY-1782-2,1,124.353

tell him my children are starving ! BURNEY-1782-2,1,124.354

and tell him my poor Billy , that used to help to keep us , is dead ,
and that all the work I can do by myself is not enough to maintain us !
" BURNEY-1782-2,1,124.355

" Good heaven ! " cried Cecilia , extremely moved ,
BURNEY-1782-2,1,124.356

" is it then your own money for which you sue thus humbly ? "
BURNEY-1782-2,1,124.357

" Yes , madam , for my own just and honest money , as his honour knows ,
and will tell you himself . " BURNEY-1782-2,1,124.358

" Impossible ! " cried Cecilia , BURNEY-1782-2,1,124.359

" he can@ @not know it ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,124.360

but I will take care he shall <P_1,125> soon be informed of it .
BURNEY-1782-2,1,125.361

How much is the bill ? " BURNEY-1782-2,1,125.362

" Two-and-twenty pounds , madam . " BURNEY-1782-2,1,125.363

" What , no more ? " BURNEY-1782-2,1,125.364

" Ah madam , you gentlefolks little think how much that is to poor
people ! BURNEY-1782-2,1,125.365

A hard_working family , like mine , madam , with the help of 20 <font>
l. <$$font> will go on for a long while quite in paradise . "
BURNEY-1782-2,1,125.366

" Poor worthy woman ! " cried Cecilia , whose eyes were filled with
tears of compassion , " if 20 <font> l. <$$font> will place you in
paradise , and that 20 <font> l. <$$font> only your just right , it is
hard , indeed , that you should be kept without it ; especially when
your debtors are too affluent to miss it . BURNEY-1782-2,1,125.367

Stay here a few moments , BURNEY-1782-2,1,125.368

and I will bring you the money immediately . " BURNEY-1782-2,1,125.369

Away she flew , BURNEY-1782-2,1,125.370

and returned to the breakfast room , BURNEY-1782-2,1,125.371

but found there only Mr. Arnott , who told her that Mr. Harrel was in
the library , with his sister and some gentlemen .
BURNEY-1782-2,1,125.372

Cecilia briefly related her business , BURNEY-1782-2,1,125.373

and begged he would inform Mr. Harrel she wished to speak to him
directly . BURNEY-1782-2,1,125.374

Mr. Arnott shook his head ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,125.375

but obeyed . BURNEY-1782-2,1,125.376

They returned together , BURNEY-1782-2,1,125.377

and immediately " Miss Beverley , " cried Mr. Harrel , gaily ,
BURNEY-1782-2,1,125.378

" I am glad you are not gone , BURNEY-1782-2,1,125.379

for <P_1,126> we want much to consult with you .
BURNEY-1782-2,1,126.380

Will you come up stairs ? " BURNEY-1782-2,1,126.381

" Presently , " answered she ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,126.382

" but first I must speak to you about a poor woman with whom I have
accidentally been talking , who has begged me to intercede with you to
pay a little debt that she thinks you have forgotten , but that probably
you have never heard mentioned . " BURNEY-1782-2,1,126.383

" A debt ? " cried he , with an immediate change of countenance , " to
whom ? " BURNEY-1782-2,1,126.384

" Her name , I think , is Hill ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,126.385

she is wife to the carpenter you employed about a new temple at
Violet-Bank . BURNEY-1782-2,1,126.386

" O what - what that woman ? BURNEY-1782-2,1,126.387

- Well , well , I@ @'ll see she shall be paid . BURNEY-1782-2,1,126.388

Come , BURNEY-1782-2,1,126.389

let us go to the library . " BURNEY-1782-2,1,126.390

" What , with my commission so ill executed ? BURNEY-1782-2,1,126.391

I promised to petition for her to have the money directly . "
BURNEY-1782-2,1,126.392

" Pho , pho , there@ @'s no such hurry ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,126.393

I do@ @n't know what I have done with her bill . "
BURNEY-1782-2,1,126.394

" I@ @'ll run and get another , " BURNEY-1782-2,1,126.395

" O upon no account ! BURNEY-1782-2,1,126.396

She may send another in two or three days . BURNEY-1782-2,1,126.397

She deserves to wait a twelvemonth for her impertinence in troubling you
at all about it . " BURNEY-1782-2,1,126.398

" That was entirely accidental : BURNEY-1782-2,1,126.399

but indeed you must give me leave to perform my promise and plead for
her . BURNEY-1782-2,1,126.400

It must be almost <P_1,127> the same to you whether you pay such a
trifle as 20 <font> l. <$$font> now , or a month hence ,
BURNEY-1782-2,1,127.401

and to this poor woman , the difference seems little short of life or
death , BURNEY-1782-2,1,127.402

for she tells me her husband is dying , and her children are half
famished BURNEY-1782-2,1,127.403

, and though she looks an object of the cruellest want and distress
herself , she appears to be their only support . "
BURNEY-1782-2,1,127.404

" O , " cried Mr. Harrel , laughing , " what a dismal tale has she been
telling you ! BURNEY-1782-2,1,127.405

no doubt she saw you were fresh from the country !
BURNEY-1782-2,1,127.406

But if you give credit to all the farragos of these trumpery impostors ,
you will never have a moment to yourself , nor a guinea in your purse .
" BURNEY-1782-2,1,127.407

" This woman , " answered Cecilia , " can@ @not be an impostor ,
BURNEY-1782-2,1,127.408

she carries marks but too evident and too dreadful in her countenance of
the sufferings which she relates . " BURNEY-1782-2,1,127.409

" O , " returned he , " when you know the town better , you will soon
see through tricks of this sort ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,127.410

a sick husband and five small children are complaints so stale now ,
that they serve no other purpose in the world but to make a joke . "
BURNEY-1782-2,1,127.411

" Those , however , who can laugh at them must have notions of merriment
very different to mine . BURNEY-1782-2,1,127.412

And this poor woman , whose cause I have ventured to undertake , had she
no family at all , must still and indisputably be an object of pity
herself , BURNEY-1782-2,1,127.413

<P_1,128>

for she is so weak she can hardly crawl , and so pallid , that she seems
already half dead . " BURNEY-1782-2,1,128.415

" All imposition , depend upon it ! BURNEY-1782-2,1,128.416

The moment she is out of your sight , her complaints will vanish . "
BURNEY-1782-2,1,128.417

" Nay , sir , " cried Cecilia , a little impatiently , " there is no
reason to suspect such deceit , since she does not come hither as a
beggar , however well the state of beggary may accord with her poverty :
BURNEY-1782-2,1,128.418

she only sollicits the payment of a bill , BURNEY-1782-2,1,128.419

and if in that there is any fraud , nothing can be so easy as detection
. " BURNEY-1782-2,1,128.420

Mr. Harrel bit his lips at this speech , BURNEY-1782-2,1,128.421

and for some instants looked much disturbed ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,128.422

but soon recovering himself , he negligently said " Pray how did she get
at you ? " BURNEY-1782-2,1,128.423

" I met her at the street door . BURNEY-1782-2,1,128.424

But tell me , is not her bill a just one ? " BURNEY-1782-2,1,128.425

" I can@ @not say ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,128.426

I have never had time to look at it . " BURNEY-1782-2,1,128.427

" But you know who the woman is , and that her husband worked for you ,
and therefore that in all probability it is right , - do you not ? "
BURNEY-1782-2,1,128.428

" Yes , yes , I know who the woman is well enough ;
BURNEY-1782-2,1,128.429

she has taken care of that , BURNEY-1782-2,1,128.430

for she has pestered me every day these nine months . "
BURNEY-1782-2,1,128.431

Cecilia was struck dumb by this speech : BURNEY-1782-2,1,128.432

<P_1,129>

hitherto she had supposed that the dissipation of his life kept him
ignorant of his own injustice ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,129.434

but when she found he was so well informed of it , yet , with such total
indifference , could suffer a poor woman to claim a just debt every day
for nine months together , she was shocked and astonished beyond measure
. BURNEY-1782-2,1,129.435

They were both some time silent , BURNEY-1782-2,1,129.436

and then Mr. Harrel , yawning and stretching out his arms , indolently
asked " Pray why does not the man come himself ? "
BURNEY-1782-2,1,129.437

" Did I not tell you , " answered Cecilia , staring at so absent a
question , " that he was very ill , and unable even to work ? "
BURNEY-1782-2,1,129.438

" Well , when he is better , " added he , moving towards the door , " he
may call , BURNEY-1782-2,1,129.439

and I will talk to him . " BURNEY-1782-2,1,129.440

Cecilia , all amazement at this unfeeling behaviour , turned
involuntarily to Mr. Arnott , with a countenance that appealed for his
assistance ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,129.441

but Mr. Arnott hung his head , ashamed to meet her eyes ,
BURNEY-1782-2,1,129.442

and abruptly left the room . BURNEY-1782-2,1,129.443

Mean_time Mr. Harrel , half turning back , though without looking
Cecilia in the face , carelessly said , " Well , wo@ @n't you come ? "
BURNEY-1782-2,1,129.444

" No , sir , " answered she , coldly . BURNEY-1782-2,1,129.445

He then returned to the library , leaving her equally displeased ,
surprised and disconcerted <P_1,130> at the conversation which had just
passed between them . BURNEY-1782-2,1,130.446

" Good heaven , " cried she to herself , BURNEY-1782-2,1,130.447

" what strange , what cruel insensibility ! to suffer a wretched family
to starve , from an obstinate determination to assert that they can live
! to distress the poor by retaining the recompence for which alone they
labour , and which at last they must have , merely from indolence ,
forgetfulness , or insolence ! BURNEY-1782-2,1,130.448

O how little did my uncle know , BURNEY-1782-2,1,130.449

how little did I imagine to what a guardian I was intrusted ! "
BURNEY-1782-2,1,130.450

She now felt ashamed even to return to the poor woman , though she
resolved to do all in her power to soften her disappointment , and
relieve her distress . BURNEY-1782-2,1,130.451

But before she had quitted the room , one of the servants came to tell
her that his master begged the honor of her company up stairs .
BURNEY-1782-2,1,130.452

" Perhaps he relents ! " thought she ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,130.453

and pleased with the hope , readily obeyed the summons .
BURNEY-1782-2,1,130.454

She found him , his lady , Sir Robert Floyer , and two other gentlemen ,
all earnestly engaged in an argument over a large table , which was
covered with plans and elevations of small buildings .
BURNEY-1782-2,1,130.455

Mr. Harrel immediately addressed her with an air of vivacity
BURNEY-1782-2,1,130.456

and said " You are very good for coming ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,130.457

we can settle nothing without your advice : BURNEY-1782-2,1,130.458

pray look at <P_1,131> these different plans for our theatre ,
BURNEY-1782-2,1,131.459

and tell us which is the best . " BURNEY-1782-2,1,131.460

Cecilia advanced not a step : BURNEY-1782-2,1,131.461

the sight of plans for new edifices when the workmen were yet unpaid for
old ones ; the cruel wantonness of raising fresh fabrics of expensive
luxury , while those so lately built had brought their neglected
labourers to ruin , excited an indignation she scarce thought right to
repress : while the easy sprightliness of the director of these revels ,
to whom but the moment before she had represented the oppression of
which they made him guilty , filled her with aversion and disgust :
BURNEY-1782-2,1,131.462

and , recollecting the charge given her by the stranger at the Opera
rehearsal , she resolved to speed her departure to another house ,
internally repeating " Yes , I <font> will <$$font> save myself from
<font> the impending destruction of unfeeling prosperity ! <$$font> "
BURNEY-1782-2,1,131.463

Mrs. Harrel , surprised at her silence and extreme gravity , enquired
if she was not well , and why she had put off her visit to Miss Larolles
? BURNEY-1782-2,1,131.464

And Sir Robert Floyer , turning suddenly to look at her , said " Do you
begin to feel the London air already ? " BURNEY-1782-2,1,131.465

Cecilia endeavoured to recover her serenity , and answer these questions
in her usual manner ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,131.466

but she persisted in declining to give any opinion at all about the
plans , BURNEY-1782-2,1,131.467

<P_1,132>

and , after slightly looking at them , left the room .
BURNEY-1782-2,1,132.469

Mr. Harrel , who knew better how to account for her behaviour than he
thought proper to declare , saw with concern that she was more seriously
displeased , than he had believed an occurrence which he had regarded as
wholly unimportant , could have made her : BURNEY-1782-2,1,132.470

and therefore , desirous that she should be appeased , he followed her
out of the library , BURNEY-1782-2,1,132.471

and said " Miss Beverley , will to-morrow be soon enough for your <font>
Protegée {TEXT:Protegeé} ? " <$$font> BURNEY-1782-2,1,132.472

" O yes , no doubt ! " answered she , most agreeably surprised by the
question . BURNEY-1782-2,1,132.473

" Well , then , will you take the trouble to bid her come to me in the
morning ? " BURNEY-1782-2,1,132.474

Delighted at this unexpected commission , she thanked him with smiles
for the office ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,132.475

and as she hastened down stairs to chear the poor expectant with the
welcome intelligence , she framed a_thousand excuses for the part he had
hitherto acted , BURNEY-1782-2,1,132.476

and without any difficulty , persuaded herself he began to see the
faults of his conduct , and to meditate a reformation .
BURNEY-1782-2,1,132.477

She was received by the poor creature she so warmly wished to serve with
a countenance already so much enlivened , that she fancied Mr. Harrel
had himself anticipated her intended information :
BURNEY-1782-2,1,132.478

this , however , <P_1,133> she found was not the case ,
BURNEY-1782-2,1,133.479

for as soon as she heard his message , she shook her head ,
BURNEY-1782-2,1,133.480

and said " Ah , madam , his honour always says tomorrow !
BURNEY-1782-2,1,133.481

but I can better bear to be disappointed now , BURNEY-1782-2,1,133.482

so I@ @'ll grumble no more ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,133.483

for indeed , madam , I have been blest enough to-day to comfort me for
every thing in the world , if I could but keep from thinking of poor
Billy ! BURNEY-1782-2,1,133.484

I could bear all the rest , madam , BURNEY-1782-2,1,133.485

but whenever my other troubles go off , that comes back to me so much
the harder ! " BURNEY-1782-2,1,133.486

" There , indeed , I can afford you no relief , " said Cecilia ,
BURNEY-1782-2,1,133.487

" but you must try to think less of him , and more of your husband and
children who are now alive . BURNEY-1782-2,1,133.488

Tomorrow you will receive your money , BURNEY-1782-2,1,133.489

and that , I hope , will raise your spirits . BURNEY-1782-2,1,133.490

And pray let your husband have a physician , to tell you how to nurse
and manage him ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,133.491

I will give you one fee for him now , BURNEY-1782-2,1,133.492

and if he should want further advice , do@ @n't fear to let me know . "
BURNEY-1782-2,1,133.493

Cecilia had again taken out her purse , BURNEY-1782-2,1,133.494

but Mrs. Hill , clasping her hands , called out " Oh madam no !
BURNEY-1782-2,1,133.495

I do@ @n't come here to fleece such goodness ! BURNEY-1782-2,1,133.496

but blessed be the hour that brought me here to-day ,
BURNEY-1782-2,1,133.497

and if my poor Billy was alive , he should help me to thank you ! "
BURNEY-1782-2,1,133.498

She then told her that she was now quite <P_1,134> rich ,
BURNEY-1782-2,1,134.499

for while she was gone , a gentleman had come into the room , who had
given her five guineas . BURNEY-1782-2,1,134.500

Cecilia , by her description , soon found this gentleman was Mr. Arnott
, BURNEY-1782-2,1,134.501

and a charity so sympathetic with her own , failed not to raise him
greatly in her favour . BURNEY-1782-2,1,134.502

But as her benevolence was a stranger to that parade which is only
liberal from emulation , when she found more money not immediately
wanted , she put up her purse , BURNEY-1782-2,1,134.503

and charging Mrs. Hill to enquire for her the next morning when she
came to be paid , bid her hasten back to her sick husband .
BURNEY-1782-2,1,134.504

And then , again ordering the carriage to the door , she set off upon
her visit to Miss Larolles , with a heart happy in the good already done
, and happier still in the hope of doing more . BURNEY-1782-2,1,134.505

Miss Larolles was out , BURNEY-1782-2,1,134.506

and she returned home ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,134.507

for she was too sanguine in her expectations from Mr. Harrel , to have
any desire of seeking her other guardians . BURNEY-1782-2,1,134.508

The rest of the day she was more than usually civil to him , with a view
to mark her approbation of his good intentions ; while Mr. Arnott ,
gratified by meeting the smiles he so much valued , thought his five
guineas amply repaid , independently of the real pleasure which he took
in doing good . BURNEY-1782-2,1,134.509

<P_1,135>

Chap. X . BURNEY-1782-2,1,135.512

A Provocation . BURNEY-1782-2,1,135.513

<$$heading>

The next morning , when breakfast was over , Cecilia waited with much
impatience to hear some tidings of the poor carpenter's wife ;
BURNEY-1782-2,1,135.515

but though Mr. Harrel , who had always that meal in his own room , came
into his lady's at his usual hour , to see what was going forward , he
did not mention her name . BURNEY-1782-2,1,135.516

She therefore went into the hall herself , to enquire among the servants
if Mrs. Hill was yet come ? BURNEY-1782-2,1,135.517

Yes , they answered , BURNEY-1782-2,1,135.518

and had seen their master , BURNEY-1782-2,1,135.519

and was gone . BURNEY-1782-2,1,135.520

She then returned to the breakfast room , where her eagerness to procure
some information detained her , though the entrance of Sir Robert Floyer
made her wish to retire . BURNEY-1782-2,1,135.521

But she was wholly at a loss whether to impute to general forgetfulness
, or to the failure of performing his promise , the silence of Mr.
Harrel upon the subject of her petition . BURNEY-1782-2,1,135.522

In a few minutes they were visited by Mr. Morrice , who said he called
to acquaint <P_1,136> the ladies that the next morning there was to be a
rehearsal of a very grand new dance at the Opera-House , where , though
admission was difficult , if it was agreeable to them to go , he would
undertake to introduce them . BURNEY-1782-2,1,136.523

Mrs. Harrel happened to be engaged , BURNEY-1782-2,1,136.524

and therefore declined the offer . BURNEY-1782-2,1,136.525

He then turned to Cecilia , BURNEY-1782-2,1,136.526

and said , " Well , ma'am , when did you see our friend Monckton ? "
BURNEY-1782-2,1,136.527

Not since the rehearsal , Sir . " BURNEY-1782-2,1,136.528

" He is a mighty agreeable fellow , " he continued ,
BURNEY-1782-2,1,136.529

" and his house in the country is charming . BURNEY-1782-2,1,136.530

One is as easy at it as at home . BURNEY-1782-2,1,136.531

Were you ever there , Sir Robert ? " BURNEY-1782-2,1,136.532

" Not I , truly , " replied Sir Robert ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,136.533

" what should I go for ? BURNEY-1782-2,1,136.534

- to see an old woman with never a tooth in her head sitting at the top
of the table ! BURNEY-1782-2,1,136.535

Faith I@ @'d go an_hundred miles a day for a month never to see such a
sight again . " BURNEY-1782-2,1,136.536

" O but you do@ @n't know how well she does the honours , " said Morrice
; BURNEY-1782-2,1,136.537

" and for my part , except just at meal times , I always contrive to
keep out of her way . " BURNEY-1782-2,1,136.538

" I wonder when she intends to die , " said Mr. Harrel .
BURNEY-1782-2,1,136.539

" She@ @'s been a long time about it , " cried Sir Robert ;
BURNEY-1782-2,1,136.540

" but those tough old cats last for ever . BURNEY-1782-2,1,136.541

We all thought she was going when Monckton married her ;
BURNEY-1782-2,1,136.542

however , <P_1,137> if he had not managed like a driveler , he might
have broke her heart nine years ago . " BURNEY-1782-2,1,137.543

" I am sure I wish he had , " cried Mrs. Harrel ,
BURNEY-1782-2,1,137.544

" for she@ @'s an odious creature , BURNEY-1782-2,1,137.545

and used always to make me afraid of her . " BURNEY-1782-2,1,137.546

" But an old woman , " answered Sir Robert , " is a person who has no
sense of decency ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,137.547

if once she takes to living , the devil himself ca@ @n't get rid of her
. " BURNEY-1782-2,1,137.548

" I dare say , " cried Morrice , " she@ @'ll pop off before long in one
of those fits of the asthma . BURNEY-1782-2,1,137.549

I assure you sometimes you may hear her wheeze a mile off . "
BURNEY-1782-2,1,137.550

" She@ @'ll go never the sooner for that , " said Sir Robert ,
BURNEY-1782-2,1,137.551

" for I have got an old aunt of my own , who has been puffing and
blowing as if she was at her last gasp ever since I can remember ;
BURNEY-1782-2,1,137.552

and for all that , only yesterday , when I asked her doctor when she@
@'d give up the ghost , he told me she might live these dozen years . "
BURNEY-1782-2,1,137.553

Cecilia was by no means sorry to have this brutal conversation
interrupted by the entrance of a servant with a letter for her .
BURNEY-1782-2,1,137.554

She was immediately retiring to read it ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,137.555

but upon the petition of Mr. Monckton , who just then came into the
room , she only went to a window . BURNEY-1782-2,1,137.556

The letter was as follows : BURNEY-1782-2,1,137.557

<P_1,138>

To Miss , at his Honour Squire Harrel@ @'s , These .
BURNEY-1782-2,1,138.559

Honoured Madam , This with my humble duty . BURNEY-1782-2,1,138.560

His Honour has given me nothing . BURNEY-1782-2,1,138.561

But I would not be troublesome , having wherewithal to wait ,
BURNEY-1782-2,1,138.562

so conclude , Honoured Madam , Your dutiful servant to command , till
death , M. Hill . BURNEY-1782-2,1,138.563

The vexation with which Cecilia read this letter was visible to the
whole company ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,138.564

and while Mr. Arnott looked at her with a wish of enquiry he did not
dare express , and Mr. Monckton , under an appearance of inattention ,
concealed the most anxious curiosity , Mr. Morrice alone had courage to
interrogate her ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,138.565

and , pertly advancing , said , " He is a happy man who writ that letter
, ma'am , BURNEY-1782-2,1,138.566

for I am sure you have not read it with indifference . "
BURNEY-1782-2,1,138.567

" Were I the writer , " said Mr. Arnott , tenderly , " I am sure I
should reckon myself for otherwise , BURNEY-1782-2,1,138.568

for Miss Beverley seems to have read it with uneasiness . "
BURNEY-1782-2,1,138.569

<P_1,139>

" However , I have read it , " answered she , " I assure you it is not
from <font> any man <$$font> . " BURNEY-1782-2,1,139.571

" O pray , Miss Beverley , " cried Sir Robert , coming forward , " are
you any better to-day ? " BURNEY-1782-2,1,139.572

" No , Sir , for I have not been ill . BURNEY-1782-2,1,139.573

A little vapoured , I thought , yesterday ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,139.574

perhaps you want exercise . " BURNEY-1782-2,1,139.575

" I wish the ladies would put themselves under my care , " cried Morrice
, " and take a turn round the park . " BURNEY-1782-2,1,139.576

" I do@ @n't doubt you , Sir , " said Mr. Monckton , contemptuously ,
BURNEY-1782-2,1,139.577

" and , but for the check of modesty , probably there is not a man here
who would not wish the same . " BURNEY-1782-2,1,139.578

" I could propose a much better scheme than that , " said Sir Robert ;
BURNEY-1782-2,1,139.579

" what if you all walk to Harley-street , and give me your notions of a
house I am about there ? BURNEY-1782-2,1,139.580

what say you , Mrs. Harrel ? " BURNEY-1782-2,1,139.581

" O , I shall like it vastly . " BURNEY-1782-2,1,139.582

" Done , " cried Mr. Harrel ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,139.583

" 't@ @is an excellent motion . " BURNEY-1782-2,1,139.584

" Come then , " said Sir Robert , BURNEY-1782-2,1,139.585

" let@ @'s be off . BURNEY-1782-2,1,139.586

Miss Beverley , I hope you have a good warm cloak ? "
BURNEY-1782-2,1,139.587

" I must beg you to excuse my attending you , Sir . "
BURNEY-1782-2,1,139.588

Mr. Monckton , who had heard this proposal with the utmost dread of its
success , <P_1,140> revived at the calm steadiness with which it was
declined . BURNEY-1782-2,1,140.589

Mr. and Mrs. Harrel both teased {TEXT:teized} Cecilia to consent ;
BURNEY-1782-2,1,140.590

but the haughty Baronet , evidently more offended than hurt by her
refusal , pressed the matter no further : either with her or the rest of
the party , BURNEY-1782-2,1,140.591

and the scheme was dropt entirely . BURNEY-1782-2,1,140.592

Mr. Monckton failed not to remark this circumstance , which confirmed
his suspicions , that though the proposal seemed made by chance , its
design was nothing else than to obtain Cecilia's opinion concerning his
house . BURNEY-1782-2,1,140.593

But while this somewhat alarmed him , the unabated insolence of his
carriage , and the confident defiance of his pride , still more
surprized him ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,140.594

and notwithstanding all he observed of Cecilia , seemed to promise
nothing but dislike ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,140.595

he could draw no other inference from his behaviour , than that if he
admired , he also concluded himself sure of her .
BURNEY-1782-2,1,140.596

This was not a pleasant conjecture , however little weight he allowed to
it ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,140.597

and he resolved , by outstaying all the company , to have a few minutes
private discourse with her upon the subject . BURNEY-1782-2,1,140.598

In about half an hour , Sir Robert and Mr. Harrel went out together :
BURNEY-1782-2,1,140.599

Mr. Monckton still persevered in keeping his ground ,
BURNEY-1782-2,1,140.600

and tried , though already weary , <P_1,141> to keep up a general
conversation ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,141.601

but what moved at once his wonder and his indignation was the assurance
of Morrice , who seemed not only bent upon staying as long as himself ,
but determined , by rattling away , to make his own entertainment .
BURNEY-1782-2,1,141.602

At length a servant came in to tell Mrs. Harrel that a stranger , who
was waiting in the house-keeper's room , begged to speak with her upon
very particular business . BURNEY-1782-2,1,141.603

" O I know , " cried she , " 't@ @is that odious John Groot :
BURNEY-1782-2,1,141.604

do pray , brother , try to get rid of him for me ,
BURNEY-1782-2,1,141.605

for he comes to teize me about his bill , BURNEY-1782-2,1,141.606

and I never know what to say to him . " {TEXT:"_"}
BURNEY-1782-2,1,141.607

Mr. Arnott went immediately , BURNEY-1782-2,1,141.608

and Mr. Monckton could scarce refrain from going too , that he might
entreat John Groot by no means to be satisfied without seeing Mrs.
Harrel herself : BURNEY-1782-2,1,141.609

John Groot , however , wanted not his entreaties , as the servant soon
returned to summon his lady to the conference . BURNEY-1782-2,1,141.610

But though Mr. Monckton now seemed near the completion of his purpose ,
Morrice still remained ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,141.611

his vexation at this circumstance soon grew intolerable ;
BURNEY-1782-2,1,141.612

to see himself upon the point of receiving the recompence of his
perseverance , by the fortunate removal of all the obstacles in its way
, and then to have it held from him by <P_1,142> a young fellow he so
much despised , and who had no entrance into the house but through his
own boldness , and no inducement to stay in it but from his own
impertinence , mortified him so insufferably , that it was with
difficulty he even forbore affronting him . BURNEY-1782-2,1,142.613

Nor would he have scrupled a moment desiring him to leave the room , had
he not prudently determined to guard with the utmost sedulity against
raising any suspicions of his passion for Cecilia .
BURNEY-1782-2,1,142.614

He arose , however , BURNEY-1782-2,1,142.615

and was moving towards her , with intention to occupy a part of a sofa
on which she was seated , when Morrice , who was standing at the back of
it , with a sudden spring which made the whole room shake , jumpt over ,
and sunk plump into the vacant place himself , calling out at the same
time , " Come , come , what have you married men to do with young ladies
? BURNEY-1782-2,1,142.616

I shall seize this post for myself . " BURNEY-1782-2,1,142.617

The rage of Mr. Monckton at this feat , and still more at the words
<font> married men <$$font> , almost exceeded endurance ;
BURNEY-1782-2,1,142.618

he stopt short , BURNEY-1782-2,1,142.619

and looking at him with a fierceness that overpowered his discretion ,
was bursting out with , " Sir , you are an - <font> impudent fellow
<$$font> " , BURNEY-1782-2,1,142.620

but checking himself when he got halfway , concluded with , " a very
facetious gentleman ! " BURNEY-1782-2,1,142.621

Morrice , who wished nothing so little as <P_1,143> disobliging Mr.
Monckton , and whose behaviour was merely the result of levity and a
want of early education , no sooner perceived his displeasure , than
rising with yet more agility than he had seated himself , he resumed the
obsequiousness of which an uncommon flow of spirits had robbed him ,
BURNEY-1782-2,1,143.622

and guessing no other subject for his anger than the disturbance he had
made , he bowed almost to the ground , first to him , and afterwards to
Cecilia , most respectfully begging pardon of them both for his frolic ,
and protesting he had no notion he should have made such a noise !
BURNEY-1782-2,1,143.623

Mrs. Harrel and Mr. Arnott now hastening back , enquired what had been
the matter ? BURNEY-1782-2,1,143.624

Morrice , ashamed of his exploit , and frightened by the looks of Mr.
Monckton , made an apology with the utmost humility ,
BURNEY-1782-2,1,143.625

and hurried away : BURNEY-1782-2,1,143.626

and Mr. Monckton , hopeless of any better fortune , soon did the same ,
gnawn with a cruel discontent which he did not dare avow , and longing
to revenge himself upon Morrice , even by personal chastisement .

Chap. XI . BURNEY-1782-2,1,144.630

A Narration . BURNEY-1782-2,1,144.631

<$$heading>

The moment Cecilia was at liberty , she sent her own servant to examine
into the real situation of the carpenter and his family , and to desire
his wife would call upon her as soon as she was at leisure .
BURNEY-1782-2,1,144.633

The account which he brought back encreased her concern for the injuries
of these poor people , BURNEY-1782-2,1,144.634

and determined her not to rest satisfied till she saw them redressed .
BURNEY-1782-2,1,144.635

He informed her that they lived in a small lodging up two pair of stairs
; that there were five children , all girls , the three eldest of whom
were hard at work with their mother in matting chair-bottoms , and the
fourth , though a mere child , was nursing the youngest ; while the poor
carpenter himself was confined to his bed , in consequence of a fall
from a ladder while working at Violet-Bank , by which he was covered
with wounds and contusions , and an object of misery and pain .
BURNEY-1782-2,1,144.636

As soon as Mrs. Hill came , Cecilia sent for her into her own room ,
where she received <P_1,145> her with the most compassionate tenderness
, and desired to know when Mr. Harrel talked of paying her ?
BURNEY-1782-2,1,145.637

" To-morrow , madam , " she answered , shaking her head ,
BURNEY-1782-2,1,145.638

" that is always his honour's speech : BURNEY-1782-2,1,145.639

but I shall bear it while I can . BURNEY-1782-2,1,145.640

However , though I dare not tell his honour , something bad will come of
it , if I am not paid soon . " BURNEY-1782-2,1,145.641

" Do you mean , then , to apply to the law ? " BURNEY-1782-2,1,145.642

" I must not tell you , madam ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,145.643

but to be sure we have thought of it many a sad time and often ;
BURNEY-1782-2,1,145.644

but still while we could rub on , we thought it best not to make enemies
: BURNEY-1782-2,1,145.645

but , indeed , madam , his honour was so hard-hearted this morning ,
that if I was not afraid you would be angry , I could not tell how to
bear it ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,145.646

for when I told him I had no help now , for I had lost my Billy , he had
the heart to say , so much the better , BURNEY-1782-2,1,145.647

there@ @'s one the less of you . " BURNEY-1782-2,1,145.648

" But what , " cried Cecilia , extremely shocked by this unfeeling
speech , " is the reason he gives for disappointing you so often ? "
BURNEY-1782-2,1,145.649

" He says , madam , that none of the other workmen are paid yet ;
BURNEY-1782-2,1,145.650

and that , to be sure , is very true ; BURNEY-1782-2,1,145.651

but then they can all better afford to wait than we can ,
BURNEY-1782-2,1,145.652

for we were the poorest of all , madam , BURNEY-1782-2,1,145.653

and have <P_1,146> been misfortunate from the beginning :
BURNEY-1782-2,1,146.654

and his honour would never have employed us , BURNEY-1782-2,1,146.655

only he had run up such a bill with Mr. Wright , that he would not
undertake any thing more till he was paid . BURNEY-1782-2,1,146.656

We were told from the first we should not get our money ;
BURNEY-1782-2,1,146.657

but we were willing to hope for the best , BURNEY-1782-2,1,146.658

for we had nothing to do , BURNEY-1782-2,1,146.659

and were hard run , BURNEY-1782-2,1,146.660

and had never had the offer of so good a job before ;
BURNEY-1782-2,1,146.661

and we had a great family to keep , and many losses , and so much
illness ! BURNEY-1782-2,1,146.662

- Oh madam ! if you did but know what the poor go through ! "
BURNEY-1782-2,1,146.663

This speech opened to Cecilia a new view of life ;
BURNEY-1782-2,1,146.664

that a young man could appear so gay and happy , yet be guilty of such
injustice and inhumanity , that he could take pride in works which not
even money had made his own , and live with undiminished splendor , when
his credit itself began to fail , seemed to her incongruities so
irrational , that hitherto she had supposed them impossible .
BURNEY-1782-2,1,146.665

She then enquired , if her husband had yet had any physician ?
BURNEY-1782-2,1,146.666

" Yes , madam , I humbly thank your goodness , " she answered ;
BURNEY-1782-2,1,146.667

" but I am not the poorer for that , BURNEY-1782-2,1,146.668

for the gentleman was so kind he would take nothing . "
BURNEY-1782-2,1,146.669

" And does he give you any hopes ? BURNEY-1782-2,1,146.670

what does he say ? " BURNEY-1782-2,1,146.671

<P_1,147>

" He says he must die , madam ! BURNEY-1782-2,1,147.673

but I knew that before . " BURNEY-1782-2,1,147.674

" Poor woman ! and what will you do then ? " BURNEY-1782-2,1,147.675

" The same , madam , as I did when I lost my Billy ,
BURNEY-1782-2,1,147.676

work on the harder ! " BURNEY-1782-2,1,147.677

" Good heavens , how severe a lot ! BURNEY-1782-2,1,147.678

but tell me , why is it you seem to love your Billy so much better than
the rest of your children ? " BURNEY-1782-2,1,147.679

" Because , madam , he was the only boy that ever I had ;
BURNEY-1782-2,1,147.680

he was seventeen years old , madam , and as tall and as pretty a lad !
and so good , that he never cost me a wet eye till I lost him .
BURNEY-1782-2,1,147.681

He worked with his father , BURNEY-1782-2,1,147.682

and all the folks used to say he was the better workman of the two . "
