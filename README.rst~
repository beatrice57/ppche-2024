Penn Parsed Corpora of Historical English (PPCHE) - 2024 release
================================================================

The most recent release of the PPCHE is unfortunately no longer
available on github, as my posting on github infringes on prior
distribution rights by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC).

The corpora will become available from the LDC catalog shortly.
Please see the PPCHE page for details as they become available.

I apologize for any inconvenience my misunderstanding of the legal
situation may cause.

Contents
========

The ppche-2024 repository is part of an overarching project to make
available parsed texts of historical English for linguistic research.
It was developed at the University of Pennsylvania and consists of
running texts and text samples of British English prose from the
earliest Middle English documents (1100 CE) to the First World War (1914
CE).  The texts cover the following traditionally recognized periods of
English:

* the Penn-Helsinki Parsed Corpus of Middle English, second edition (PPCME2)
* the Penn-Helsinki Parsed Corpus of Early Modern English (PPCEME)
* the Penn Parsed Corpus of Modern British English, second edition (PPCMBE2)

The corpora are primarily intended for the use of students and scholars
of the history of English, especially the historical syntax of the
language.  They have also been used by computational linguists for
domain adaptation.

The present release differs from the previous 2016 release in that
annotation errors and inconsistencies have been corrected.  In addition,
the annotation guidelines
(<https://github.com/beatrice57/annotation-guidelines-for-ppche>) have
been streamlined to minimize differences across the three time periods
and inconsistencies across related syntactic phenomena.

All of the texts come in three forms: plain text, part-of-speech tagged
text, and syntactically annotated (parsed) text.  
Each text also has an associated file with philological information.

Each of the three subcorpora has its own directory and should be cited
individually as follows:

* Kroch, Anthony, and Ann Taylor.  2000-.  The Penn-Helsinki Parsed
  Corpus of Middle English (PPCME2), second edition, release 5.

* Kroch, Anthony, Beatrice Santorini, and Lauren Delfs.  2004-.  The
  Penn-Helsinki Parsed Corpus of Early Modern English (PPCEME), second
  edition, release 4.

* Kroch, Anthony, Beatrice Santorini, and Ariel Diertani.  2016-.
  The Penn-Helsinki Parsed Corpus of Modern British English (PPCMBE2),
  second edition, release 2.

The directory for each subcorpus in turn has two directories: data and
docs.  The data directory contains three subdirectories with the
plain and annotated text files (text, pos-tagged, parsed).
The docs directory contains a general description of each subcorpus and
a philological_info_files directory with philological information for
each text.

All data is encoded in UTF-8.  The data files are presented as plain
text, and all philological information as html.  The parsed files
are in Penn Treebank format.

Acknowledgments
===============

We are grateful to the following institutions and individuals for their
support and assistance.

* The users of the PPCHE for their years of financial support.

* Beth Randall for writing the CorpusSearch program, without which the
  corpus would not be useable for research, and for adding the corpus
  revision functions that support corpus construction.

* The users of the PPCHE who reported errors to us, notably Hezekiah
  Bacovcin, Alastair Butler, Aaron Ecay, Tom McFadden, Robert Truswell,
  and Joel Wallenberg, thereby allowing us to improve the quality of the
  corpora over time.

Annotation guidelines
=====================

As mentioned above, the annotation guidelines
(<https://github.com/beatrice57/annotation-guidelines-for-ppche>) differ
slightly from those for earlier releases.

Searching the corpora
=====================

The parsed files in the repository can be searched with CorpusSearch 2,
a Java program developed by Anthony Kroch and Beth Randall for
searching, revising, and coding parsed corpora.  The program can be
downloaded at <https://sourceforge.net/projects/corpussearch> or from
<https://github.com/beatrice57/CorpusSearch>.

<p> The original users guide site is no longer being maintained.  Please
refer instead to the corrected and revised live version
(<https://github.com/beatrice57/CorpusSearch>).
